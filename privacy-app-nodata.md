# Judebert.com No-Data App Privacy Policy

## Plain Language
I don't collect or sell your data. I just want to make neat games and tools for my family and other like-minded folks. I don't even use ads in my apps, because they're sneaky about violating your privacy. (And there was that awful experience with my Geocities website, but let's not get into *that*.) I don't want to be a part of any of that.

If an app store needs your info to download my app, you're giving it to them, not me. If they send me any information about you, I only use it to send you the app or to add you to the authorized testers. I don't keep your data any longer than absolutely necessary to let you use the app. (Who wants to manage that anyway?)

If you have any questions, contact me at privacy@judebert.com.
