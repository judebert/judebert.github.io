<H1>TRACKBACKS DISABLED -- but manually available</H1>
<P>
Spammers have been trying to leave trackback spam at such a prodigious rate that PowWeb disabled my account.  They insisted that the index.php was the problem (twice!), but the statistics clearly show that it's the comment.php, and it received 27000 hits.  I actually had to disable the main page to convince them to turn my account back on.
</P><P>
That's right; I'm paying for the account, but <b>spammers</b> thought that it was somehow their right to shut me out of it.  "Biting the hand that feeds you" applies, somehow, although the only thing I'd ever feed {profanity deleted} spammers would be poison.  Not some quick, painless poison, either; I'd use a slow, excrutiating, see-you-in-Hell kind of poison.  Something that would cause them to lose control of their own bodily functions.  Then I'd laugh at their funerals.  There's not a court that would convict me.
</P><P>
I'd even happily go to Hell for the sin of murder, although I'd argue that spammers aren't human, and therefore my acts don't constitute murder.  If I did get sent below, though, they'd better start praying -- if that even helps the Damned.  I wouldn't have the kindhearted mercy the demons would demonstrate.
