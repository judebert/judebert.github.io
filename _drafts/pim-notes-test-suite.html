Okay, I can't find a category for this, so it officially goes in The Attic.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I've lost one of the best PDAs I ever had: my Treo.  I've traded it for a Samsung Galaxy S, loaded with lots of AT&amp;T crapware.  It's neat, but it's missing the Personal Information Management (PIM) functions that a PDA should have, and that I really need.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So I'm looking for apps that can replace the PIM functionality I lost.  I need integrated contacts, calendar, and notes.  I know lots of other people need tasks and expense tracking, but I don't: tasks always wind up as calendar events, and if you need an expense program, you should probably just give up and go get a Blackberry.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'm starting off with the note-taking functionality.  I intend to try a bunch of apps and pick the one that gets the job done best.  While I'm doing all that testing, I'll write down what I find for my future reference, and as a bonus, you get to benefit from my experiences!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'm starting with the note-taking functionality.  To keep things fair, I'm figuring out my rating scale and testing methods before I actually go rating anything.&#13;

What does a note program have to do?  Obviously, take notes.  And let you read them later.  No biggie, right?  This should be easy.&#13;
</p>&#13;

<strong>Filtering <em>(10 points)</em></strong>&#13;
<p>&#13;
Oh, right.  It would be nice to arrange the notes in small groups.  Otherwise we'd be facing a sea of notes with no way to get the data we want back out.  &#13;
</p>
<p>&#13;
I like tags, because a single note can go in more than one place.  Other methods of filtering I can think of are folders (which implies a file system) and categories (which are like tags, but only one per note).  &#13;
</p>
<p>&#13;
Note that, unless it can limit the display according to this attribute, it's not really filtering; so if you can apply tags, but you can't look at all the notes tagged "Personal", it doesn't count.  Additionally, if it can't display notes without an attribute, it's not filtering either.&#13;
</p>
<p>&#13;
<u>Score</u><br />&#13;
Filter by tags: 10 points<br />&#13;
Filter by categories: 5 points<br />&#13;
Filter by folders: 5 points<br />&#13;
No filtering: 0 points<br />&#13;
</p>
<p>&#13;
There are other methods of filtering, some of which are occasionally useful.  If the note app does any of these, give it some extra points:&#13;
</p>
<p>&#13;
<u>Bonus Score</u><br />&#13;
Filter by date: +1 point<br />&#13;
Filter by multiple attributes: +1 points<br />&#13;
Filter with boolean expressions: +2 points<br />&#13;
</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<strong>Quick Note <em>(20 points)</em></strong>&#13;
<p>Lots of the note-taking I do is simple, quick little notes: a Wi-Fi network ID and WEP password, a vocabulary word to look up later, a passing idea... &#13;
</p>
<p>&#13;
Starting from the home screen, measure how long it takes to enter this note:&#13;
</p>
<pre>&#13;
Roku hostname: rokutastic&#13;
Tivo hostname: dvr&#13;
&#13;
</pre>
<p>&#13;
<u>Score</u><br />&#13;
Under 20 seconds: 20 points<br />&#13;
20-40 seconds: 15 points<br />&#13;
40-60 seconds: 10 points<br />&#13;
60 or more seconds: 5 points<br />&#13;
</p>&#13;
