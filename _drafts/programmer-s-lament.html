<p>&#13;
Lately, I've been experiencing a lot of what I call <em>Programmer's Lament</em>.  I'm certain it happens in other professions, too, but computers are so widespread that it happens a lot more often to us programmers.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Programmer's Lament is that feeling of "I could've done it better."  It happens to me all the time.  Even in the checkout aisle at the supermarket.  I'll look at the stupid credit card machine and think, "With just ten lines of code, I could've eliminated this annoying button-press."  Visiting websites, I'll imagine the six minor changes that could've made it fluid-width, or standard HTML.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
One current Lament is my Roku.  It gets the movies from Netflix alright, but it could be much better.  With a few dozen lines, I could have a nice list of movie titles, instead of that long line of box covers.  With an extra two bytes and ten lines, I could sort them by their rating.  Or by their projected rating.  Or by how recently I've watched them, considering many of them are series.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
With a hundred lines or so, I could even write something that would recommend new titles for the queue, without having to go to my computer.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But, since the source code isn't available, I can't make the changes.  I'm stuck, forever, with a substandard user experience that I could do something about, <em>if only they'd let me</em>.&#13;
