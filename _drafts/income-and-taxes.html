<p>&#13;
I recently posted some statistics to Google+ about <i>Effective Tax Rates</i>.  That's the total amount of tax you pay, divided by your total income.  It seems to me like this is the most important statistic when discussing taxation.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
My intent was to debunk the widely-held belief that the "wealthy" don't pay their "fair share".  (Yup, quotes.  Before we can have any reasonable discussion, we need to define those terms.)  The data I posted, which came from the Congressional Budget Office, showed that the effective tax rate for <b>everybody</b> was around 15% or so.  It was split into "quintiles", or groups of 20% of the population.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
That got me in trouble with my wife this morning.  Apparently she thought I was saying something entirely different.  So now I'm considering what fairness means, with respect to taxes.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I believe it's important to decide on the definitions first, without numbers.  That way I won't be (as) subject to bias.  So, let's consider what a fair tax system might look like, using only convenient numbers, and then go see how the real world compares.&#13;
<a id="extended"></a></p><p>&#13;
One ideal of fairness is having everyone pay for only what they want.  That's not the society we have, though, so I only mention it as a starting point.  After all, Luddites helped pay for the space program, pacifists help pay for the armed forces, and everybody pays for subsidies.  The idea is that we all pay the government to provide services we all "need" -- where "need" is pretty broadly defined, and really comes down to "the stuff we've historically paid for, and a little more, too".&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So fairness in this context is much more Socialistic: it's the idea that everyone should pay about the same percentage of their resources to the government.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But even that fails.  Consider a small percentage, like 10%.  Someone who only makes $20K may not be able to pay $2000 to the government and still feed his family, while a person who makes $200K can almost certainly pay his 10% without any grievous hardship.  ("Sorry, honey, no new Lexus this year.  You'll just have to settle for a nice American sedan.")  Then fairness becomes much more Communistic: those with greater means should make greater contributions.    &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Now that we've agreed that our tax system is Communistic, we can get on to the particulars.  ;)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
First off, we have to define who's "poor", and therefore exempt from shouldering the tax burden, and who's "wealthy", and should therefore pick up the slack.  I sort of like splitting the entire population into the three groups by income, corresponding with the three classes ingrained into American minds: the poor, the middle class, and the wealthy.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Under this interpretation, anyone in the bottom 1/3 of all incomes wouldn't pay any taxes.  The lost revenue would be provided equally by those among the top 1/3.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
And now we come to the problem of defining income.  At first glance, it seems obvious that incomes range from 0 to some maximum.  For the sake of convenience, let's assume the greatest income in all of America is $300K.  (It's easy to divide by 3.)  One way to split up this income would be in numeric thirds: anyone making under $100K is poor, anyone else up to $200K is middle-class, and everyone else is wealthy.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
This could result in a very few people with high incomes paying the majority of the taxes.  In fact, if there are a&#13;
