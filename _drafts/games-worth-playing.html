<p>I like to play games.  I'm even willing to pay for a fun experience.  But if I have to play alone, it's not worth playing.  Network Multiplayer all the way!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But I have a Linux computer, and my friends and family mostly run Windows.  Surely there's something we can all play together?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
You betcha.  Here's a list of games that are worth playing -- partly because you can play them with anyone, anywhere.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><h3>Quick Fun for Everyone</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
To start with, let's consider an entirely original game: <a href="http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/v5">Liquid War</a>.  Despite the title, there's no violence whatsoever.  (Oh, if you insist, I suppose you could <i>imagine</i> some violence.  Up to you.)  It's probably best described as a Real-Time Strategy game, but there's only one control: you can move your cursor.  Your dots try to take the shortest route to your cursor, and they change any opponent-dots in their way to your control.  Nobody dies.  When all the dots are controlled by one player, the game is over.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Short matches, dirt-simple play, and multiplayer networking on virtually <b>ANY</b> computer make this a real winner.  Even my kids love to play!&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>Cute Violence</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
<a href="http://www.teewars.com/">TeeWars</a>, on the other hand, does have violence.  Think liero, or Soldat, or Worms that are too impatient to wait for their turn.  It's lots of quick, violent fun -- even if I'm still trying to get the hang of the controls.  (Stupid chain.)&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>Multiplayer... Lemmings?</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
The only phrase I can think  of to describe <a href="http://www.clonk.de/contents_en.html">Clonk</a> is "multiplayer Lemmings".  Clonk Rage is not Open Source, but it is free, and it works on Linux, PC, and Mac.  You tell your Clonks to mine, dig, carry, and build; the physics engine buries your Clonks in sand, or fills your mining tunnels with rain, or catches your oil well on fire.  I found it a little difficult to learn, but it has endless possibilities.  And it's appropriate for 7-year-old kids, too.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>Historical Strategy</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
You may remember Civilization, the original historical strategy game.  Unfortunately, it left Linux users out of the fun, so we created <a href="http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">FreeCiv</a>.  We're a tolerant, open-minded bunch, though; we made it so <i>everyone</i> can play.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It's not exactly a clone of any of the Civilization games.  It's stripped to the gameplay, without the music or cutscenes (no palace for you!), and a lot more flexibility.  But if you've got a <i>lot</i> of free time on your hands (or friends who are willing to pick up a game where you left off last week), FreeCiv is a blast.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>Turn-Based Strategy</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
For years the Linux geeks have been talking about <a href="http://www.wesnoth.org/">Battle for Wesnoth</a>.  There's a reason: it's deeply strategic fun.  The single player campaigns are engrossing, but the multiplayer scenarios are the way to go!  I hear you can finish multiplayer scenario in an hour or so.  Luckily, you can also save the game and pick it up again next week.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The graphics have greatly improved since the first time I played, too.  They're a little old-fashioned now, but they serve their purpose admirably and attractively.  I sincerely believe that if someone made some eye-candy babe art for advertising banners, Wesnoth would become the standard multiplayer TBS game.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>Real-Time Strategy</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
The RTS genre is well-served by <a href="http://spring.clan-sy.com/">Spring</a>, an improvement on Total Annihilation, which is widely believed to be one of the best RTS games to date.  Spring requires you to own the original Total Annihilation to play some mods, because they require the copyrighted graphics and scripts.  But there are a lot of other mods, many of which are completely free content.  Gundam, anyone?  How about WWII (Spring: 1944)?  Or maybe you're more into Tron (Kernel Panic)?  Spring has it all.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>Multiplayer Space Combat</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
If you like ship-to-ship space combat, you must try <a href="http://xpilot.sourceforge.net/">XPilot-ng</a>.  If you've ever played Subspace, the idea will be familiar.  There are several different variations you can play, including an asteroids flavor, team combat, racing, and capture-the-flag.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
If you like vector graphics, try the original: <a href="http://xpilot.org/">XPilot</a>.  The clients and servers are supposed to be compatible, so you can all play together no matter what you're using. &#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>Massively Multiplayer Role Playing</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
Sometimes you just have too many friends for a game with a player limit.  While most of the popular MMORPG games (like World of Warcraft, or EverQuest) can be played on Linux, often they require compatibility libraries like WINE.  And I don't want to pay monthly for a game I seldom have time to play.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Enter the free MMO games!  <a href="http://www.deliantra.net/index.html">Deliantra</a> and <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/?arianne_url=games/game_stendhal">Stendhal</a> are fun, complete, games that you don't have to pay a cent for.  <a href="http://www.themanaworld.org/http://www.themanaworld.org/">The Mana World</a> is improving, too; it's still in development, so you can influence their worlds and story lines if you've got the creative bug.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>Must... Blow Something Up</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
I don't often play First-Person Shooters; they make me motion sick.  (But I loved Descent II, and had no problem with it.  Go figure.)  But they're so popular that, even within a demanding mixed-platform environment, there are lots of choices: <a href="http://www.moddb.com/games/5727/openarena">OpenArena</a>; <a href="http://www.alientrap.org/nexuiz/&gt;Nexuiz&lt;/a&gt;;%20&lt;a%20href=" http:="">Cube</a> and its successor, <a href="http://www.sauerbraten.org/">Sauerbraten</a>; <a href="http://padworld.myexp.de/index.php?media">World of Padman</a>; and <a href="http://red.planetarena.org/">Alien Arena</a> come to mind.  Each has its own strengths; Sauerbraten allows in-game modification, OpenArena works on low-spec computers, Alien Arena has two different races, and PadMan features only cartoon violence.  <a href="http://www.linux-gamers.net/smartsection.item.81/comparison-of-free-software-shooters.html">Here's an article that compares the open FPS games in greater detail.</a>&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'm looking into <a href="http://emptyclip.sourceforge.net/">Empty Clip</a>, a 2D top-down shooter.  I guess that makes it a Second Person Shooter.  Still, it's multiplayer, Open Source, crossplatform mayhem.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>Team Combat</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
You're probably thinking CounterStrike right now, but that won't run on my Linux box.  No, I'm talking about <a href="http://tremulous.net/">Tremulous</a>, an interesting mix of FPS and RTS.  The only "resources" are enemy kills, but you have to build your own spawn points, healing stations, and base defenses.  Humans get credits to purchase new gear; aliens get to evolve after each kill.  The key is working together.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>All By Myself...</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
You know, perhaps there are a few things you can play alone that are worthwhile.  Sim City, anyone?  The Open Source version is called <a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/home/micropolis/">Micropolis</a>.  And I love <a href="http://www.nethack.org">NetHack</a>; one of these days I'll have to try that <a href="http://www.darkarts.co.za/project/vultures">nice graphical Nethack interface, Vulture's Eye</a>.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>Still Needs Improvement</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
<a href="http://www.boswars.org/index.shtml">Battle of Survival</a> is a fun RTS that works on almost any platform.  It's completely open, and feels like a cross between Red Alert and Starcraft.  It needs some work on the pathfinding, I'm afraid.  I think the single-player mode is way too difficult, because the computer keeps swarming over me.&#13;
</p><p></p>&#13;
<a href="http://www.glest.org/en/index.html">Glest</a> is still improving, but it's good fun, too.  The two races here are magic vs. technology.  Fully 3D, and easy to modify: just use the provided tools and edit some XML.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<h3>Unknown Fun</h3>&#13;
<p>&#13;
There are some games I haven't tried out myself.  <a href="http://www.mtp-target.org">MTP Target</a> claims to feature "original game play", but it sure looks a lot like Super Monkey Ball's Monkey Target.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<hr />&#13;
<p>&#13;
Did I miss your favorite cross-platform game?  Tell me about it -- I love being exposed to new experiences.  Especially fun ones.  Just remember: I run Debian Linux, and my friends run Microsoft Windows, with a few Mac weirdos joining in every once in a while.  If we can't all play together, we're not going to play at all.&#13;
