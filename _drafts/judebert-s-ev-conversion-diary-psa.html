One of the folks on the <a href="http://www.diyelectric.car.com/forums/">DIY Electric Car Forums</a> is trying to put together a video of EVs and their owners.  Here's mine, along with the script.&#13;

EXT GARAGE - DAY&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
JUDEBERT leans up against SILENT E.&#13;

I'm Judebert, and this 88 Honda Civic Wagon is Silent E... my electric car.&#13;
</center>&#13;

</p><p>&#13;
MUSIC begins.  We see the license plate, a front-wheel shot, the interior driver's side, the interior back seat being opened to display the batteries, the interior hatch being opened to display the charger, Judebert driving to work, and a pan of the engine bay from passenger to driver's side.  MUSIC FADES to background.&#13;

VOICE<br />&#13;
Why did you convert to electric?&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p><center>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
I converted it to electric for the reliability. I've always been very hard on cars, partly because I'm bad at maintenance; these electric parts should last 20 years or more. Now I don't need to worry about oil changes, or tune-ups, or radiator fluid, or rusting mufflers. I will have to replace the batteries sometime, but I'll get plenty of warning beforehand, and it's an easy task.&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p><center>&#13;
VOICE<br />&#13;
How hard was the conversion?&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p><center>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
The conversion was easier than I expected!  There was some heavy lifting, and we had to figure out how to fit all the parts in the car.  All of the other problems were already solved by other EV builders, and the information is readily available on the Internet.  I think anybody who can make a list and use power tools can do it.&#13;
<p>&#13;

VOICE<br />&#13;
What's your mechanical skill level?&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
My mechanical skills are pretty weak.  My brother helped me, but neither of us can weld. Everything we made was built with a saw and a drill! The biggest mechanical skills we have are confidence and caution. Confidence allows us to approach any problem.  Caution makes us check all the possible consequences before we fiddle with something. It's slow, but it works.&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
VOICE<br />&#13;
Are you happy with the outcome?&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
I am extremely pleased with my electric car! It's quiet and reliable. There's an indescribable feeling you get from driving something you created yourself. It's fantastic!&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
VOICE<br />&#13;
Do you drive it to work every day?&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
I drive it to work <i>every</i> day. My employer even put in an EV charging space for me.  On weekends I drive it to the grocery store.  I also take it out to lunch a couple of times a week. It's always fun to take a lunch buddy on their first electric ride!&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
VOICE<br />&#13;
Is the range a problem?&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
Since I designed the car to fit my needs, I don't have any range problems.  If I ever need more range, I'll just replace the battery pack with something bigger. I haven't done that yet because I don't want to spend extra money for something I never use.&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
VOICE<br />&#13;
How do you charge it?&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
I charge it by plugging it in. Anywhere. &#13;
<p>&#13;
<br />EXT - WORK PARKING SPACE.  We follow Judebert as he plugs in the car as he explains the procedure.&#13;
</p>
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
The plug comes out of the old fuel door, where you used to put the gas pump nozzle. My extension cord fits 20A outlets, and I use an adapter for regular outlets.  It takes about an hour to recharge for every five miles I go. I'm thinking about wiring the car for 240V and installing a dryer plug in my garage so I can get faster fillups.&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
BACK TO SCENE&#13;
</p>
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
VOICE<br />&#13;
Is it a reliable vehicle?&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
It had better be reliable! That's why I built it! I haven't had any reliability problems in over 1000 miles, and I don't anticipate any.&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
VOICE<br />&#13;
Was it expensive to convert?&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
All told, including the car, it cost me about $7000 to convert.  I made a few mistakes, which cost an additional $1500 or so.  I checked, and it should pay for itself in 10 years or so.  But that doesn't account for the other benefits, like pollution reduction, quiet driving, the time savings and peace of mind from not worrying about mechanics, or the ease of filling up at home. &#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
VOICE<br />&#13;
Doesn't the pollution just get moved to the power plants?&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
The electricity I use to recharge the car comes from a coal-fired power plant.  That does make the plant produce more pollution, but it's less than half of what would be emitted by a gas-powered car going the same distance, no matter how you measure it.  And when the power plant switches to cleaner technology, my car gets cleaner without me lifting a finger!  I'm also considering installing solar panels so I can recharge with completely clean electricity.&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
VOICE<br />&#13;
Is it worth all the hassle?&#13;
</center>&#13;
<p>&#13;
</p>
<center>&#13;
JUDEBERT<br />&#13;
I think it was worth every penny of expense and every second of effort. Besides a reliable, clean, quiet car, I've also got a sense of accomplishment. It's been a big project, and Nathan and I completed it with spectacular results! My kids are proud of it. And everyone, especially my kids, can see that I'm more than just a big talker or a dreamer: I actually live according to my convictions.&#13;
