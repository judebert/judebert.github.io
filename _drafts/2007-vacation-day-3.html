<p>Eri only bought a one-way ticket to her wedding shower in New Jersey.  That means the rest of us have to go pick her up.  How will one dad fare in a minivan with three kids?&#13;
</p>&#13;
<h3>Day 3</h3>&#13;
<p>We woke up, got organized, and packed up.  Then disaster struck: the hotel didn't have a Free Continental Breakfast.  The kids were very disappointed.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<a id="extended"></a><p>However, they did have an attached restaurant.  We had breakfast there, eventually moving due to cigarette smoke.  I can't stand cigarette smoke, and my kids have asthma.  All in all, we really didn't like Best Western <b>at all</b>.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The kids started a rating system for hotels.  The Microtel got 4 stars (out of 5).  The Best Western got 2.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
At least there's some good news: Eri's wedding shower went off without a hitch yesterday.  She bought a train ticket to Washington, DC, where she planned to meet us later today.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But first, we went back to Luray Caverns to try out their hedge maze.  We had loads of fun, despite being cold.  The kids actually complained they couldn't feel their faces.  When we were done, Kayla and I hung out talking with the fascinating lady in the gift shop while Tatiana and Melissa had a race through the maze: 7:21, with Tatiana narrowly beating Melissa.  Unfortunately, it looked like there should have been a pushing penalty, which would result in either a tie or Melissa narrowly beating Tatiana.  Either way, they had fun.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We picked up souvenirs: a glowing fridge magnet for Eri, a cave puzzle for Omi, a name mug for Kayla, and giant Luray Caverns mug for Melissa, a warm "Get Lost!  (Luray Caverns Hedge Maze)" hat for Tatiana, and a Gridworks puzzle book for me (not branded, but a memento of puzzling times nonetheless).  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Then we took off to pick up Mommy.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It wasn't not too far, but Eri got a big head start.  Her train had a power outage, which slowed her down.  She still arrived hours before us.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Mostly because the stupid AAA maps mucked up again.  They sent me down some residential area instead of taking the main roads.  Eri got a map and started giving me directions on the phone.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
When I finally got to Washington, Eri said it looked like the AAA maps sent me all the way <b>around</b> Washington.  But she gave me directions to Union Station.  Unfortunately, we couldn't find me on the map until nearly the last minute.  By this time, Eri's feet hurt from standing around for two hours, and she was frustrated from that and having trouble finding me.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
As I pulled up to the Union Station roundabout, a cop pulled in behind me.  I figured it must be coincidence.  Eri tried to instruct me on some of the subtleties of the roundabout over the phone.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Washington is crazy for Florida people.  The lights are on the sides of the road, instead of strung over the lanes.  The street signs are hidden, or too small to read from a distance.  And nobody makes room for anyone else under any conditions.  As I tried to get into the inside lane behind a bus, I suddenly realized I was running a red light.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The cop stayed right behind me, but didn't turn on his lights.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Until we were pulling into the station.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Then he cited me for cell phone usage while operating a motor vehicle, although he turned it into a warning because I'm from Florida and might not have known about that law.  But he gave me a $75 ticket for running a red light.  He claimed that if I hadn't been using a cell phone, I might not have made that mistake; I didn't argue, but it's an unfounded accusation.  Studies show that talking to someone else causes distraction regardless of whether it's a cell phone or not.  <b>Dialing</b> a cell phone causes big problems, and answering one is pretty bad, too; but talking, with or without a hands-free kit, is no different than talking with a friend in the front seat.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I wasn't going to argue with him, though.  I missed the red light because traffic is crazy in Washington, but I missed it.  I'll pay the fine.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We tried to do some sightseeing in Washington, but we couldn't get to Capitol Hill or the White House.  They've closed the whole place up.  I'm pretty upset about that: we now have a spectator government.  (But that's a topic for another rant.)  We eventually decided to split up: I took the older girls on a walk through the cold rain to the Lincoln Memorial.  Eri drove Kayla to the Smithsonian.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Eri couldn't find any parking, so she looped around and picked us up.  I wanted nothing more than to get the **** out of Washington.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We went straight to our hotel, the Clarion Inn and Fun Dome.  Organizing everybody was a little more difficult with a second authority around, but we eventually got everything settled.  I introduced Eri to the "We all work together to make everyone happy" philosophy; she was a little too tired and frustrated to embrace it fully, but she liked the idea.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We had dinner in the hotel restaurant, then the kids played shuffleboard and minigolf until bedtime.  It's nice to be sleeping with my wife again.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Today was the closest we've gotten to a problem on the trip.  But we're still holding up.  I hope the rest of the trip works out.&#13;
