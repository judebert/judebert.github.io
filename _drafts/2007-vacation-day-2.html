<p>Eri only bought a one-way ticket to her wedding shower in New Jersey.  That means the rest of us have to go pick her up.  How will one dad fare in a minivan with three kids?&#13;
</p>&#13;
<h3>Day 2</h3>&#13;
<p>It looks like I'm waking up at 6:30 every day this trip.  I don't think Kayla will sleep later than that, and I can't exactly send her to another room to play quietly.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I organized everybody again, getting our stuff ready to take out, and checking the room to make sure we hadn't left anything behind.  The kids just really wanted to have their Free Continental Breakfast, which is the highlight of the trip for them.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
It's just breakfast.  But they loved it anyway.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
On the way out, we saw the hotel's watch cat again.  He doesn't seem to have moved.  And of course, the kids are so unaccustomed to the cold that they consider this cruel and inhumane punishment.  Really, the cat's fine: not only does he have fur, they bought a little shelter for him.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Poor Kayla.  She didn't listen to me, so I didn't let her pet the cat for a whole ten minutes.  She was frantic.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We got back on our way.  Today was planned to be a long leg: all the way to Luray, Virginia, where the <a href="http://www.luraycaverns.com/index.html">Luray Caverns</a> are.  (Eri's already seen them.  She's already been everywhere.)  Melissa is particularly excited by the Stalacpipe Organ.  Okay, I am too.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Unfortunately, I had forgotten my belt.  My jeans just won't stay up without one.  And all the kids were clamoring about long-sleeve shirts, snow jackets, or mittens.  Really, it's not that cold.  Nevertheless, we went to the nearby mall.  I got a belt, then we hung around for ten minutes waiting for the mall to open.  Then we spent an hour trying to find mittens under $20.  Oy vey.  We walked away with one pair of waterproof snow gloves for $11.  Obviously, more shopping to come.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I let the kids watch some more DVDs on the way up.  It's kinda cute; they're actually trying to follow the new philosophy, "We all work together to make everyone happy."  Two of them will share a DVD player, and they'll move around so the people who want to share can sit together.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The kids were quite impressed with the mountains, when they finally saw them.  I actually pulled over at the top of a hill, right below an overpass, so Melissa could get out and take pictures.  Of course, I took a crappy cellphone picture of her taking pictures.  What kind of geek would I be if I hadn't?  I miss the mountains.  I want to move somewhere mountainous.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We stopped at a few rest stops to stretch.  We decided to do a drive-through lunch, so we could get to Luray quicker; we were hoping we could actually see the caverns today, leaving more time available tomorrow.  The snacks we had packed helped things move more smoothly, too.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
As I approached Luray, VA, Melissa suddenly though to check the back of the Luray Caverns pamphlet, only discover that the caverns closed at 4PM!  It was already 3PM, and we were an hour and a half away.  I went as fast as I could, but it was already 4PM when we exited the interstate.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We decided to visit Luray Caverns anyway.  After all, maybe the brochure was out of date.  In any case, it would familiarize us with the route when we visited in the morning, as per the original plan.  The AAA maps were horrible: they use small roads, they use different names than the road signs do, and the distances are incorrect.  We finally got to the cave at 4:45.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We pulled up and saw the hours of operation sign: last tour at 4, lobby open until 5 (6 on weekends).  Everyone was disappointed.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Then Tatiana read a little closer.  Last tour at 4 (5 on weekends)!  And today was a Saturday!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We parked, rushed inside, and got our tickets.  We joined the last tour of the day!  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Luray Caverns is marvelous.  I was particularly impressed with the underground lake, and with Kayla, who stuck with us the whole time (although occasionally she feigned exhaustion and lay down on the floor).  Not to mention our tour guide, who appeared to be no older than 12.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The whole thing is just beautiful.  Melissa was taking pictures the whole time.  Kayla was scared by the mention of "Pluto's Ghost".  She kept thinking she saw an actual ghost.  As she mentioned during the tour, the only things she's scared of are ghosts, vampires, and mummies.  "And none of those are real, except mummies."  I tried to explain that mummies don't move, but she wouldn't believe me.  I don't know where she picks this stuff up.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
They closed the gift shop as the tour ended.  Then we went through their automotive museum, which closed shortly after we were through.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We had a heck of a time getting to our hotel, a Best Western (AAA recommends them).  Then we had to find a restaurant that was open at 7PM.  We found one nearby, a Chinese place.  Nice people, but full of cigarette smoke.  I had to move the kids.  The waiter was sympathetic; he related how he goes home smelling like a carton of tobacco every night, and his daughters just hate it.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Kayla nearly fell asleep in her Sesame Chicken.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
At least, with a first-floor room, we just backed up to the door and unloaded.  Melissa was a little snippy from tiredness, but I got everybody organized and asleep.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I've still got the same three kids.  Still no big problems.  Perhaps tomorrow...&#13;
</p>&#13;
