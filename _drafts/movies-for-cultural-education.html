<p>My wife and I read in the car.  It started with reading to each other in bed, and progressed quickly to the car (the other time we're together for a reasonable length of time).  I'm convinced it's one of the elements of our happy marriage.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Once we got started in the car, though, we had to watch the books for child-friendly content.  Luckily, my idea of "child friendly" differs greatly from a lot of people.  Or maybe my kids differ.  Anyway, if I can explain it to them, it's child-friendly.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So anyway, we're reading "Only You Can Save Mankind", by Terry Pratchett.  A thoroughly enjoyable book, although not on a par with his Discworld series.  I find myself explaining lots of sly references, and  I'm realizing that my kids really live in a completely different world.  For instance, they didn't understand why one of the main characters, a girl who played video games, called herself "Sigourney" in the game world.  I wound up giving them the whole plot of Alien as a footnote.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
This indicates to me that there are some movies that tap into our cultural consciousness.  Things we quote, visuals we reference, situations we understand fully from just a blip -- sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok">"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra"</a>, for all you Trekkies out there.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
My kids have to navigate around this world of giants (adults, natch), and they have learned next to nothing about the references it uses.  Naturally I've already shown them <i>The Princess Bride</i>, <i>Back to the Future</i>, and several Danny Kaye movies, and we've started the Star Trek television series.  But I need to show them a lot more.  I immediately went out and rented <i>Ghostbusters</i> to narrow the gap.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So, what movies do they need to see?  Here's my list, in order.  Not from best to worst, but from most referenced or culturally relevant to least.  The first 10 are right here, but you'll have to read further to see the rest (or argue with me).  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
</p><ol class="movielist">&#13;
<li>
<h5>The Princess Bride</h5> <h6>Halo.  My name is Inigo Montoya.  We probably reference this film more than all the others combined.</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>Grease</h5> <h6>The classic greasers movie.  Lots of depth for those who look for it.  And great music.</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>West Side Story</h5> <h6>Maria, Maria! If the music and the Shakespearean plot aren't enough, consider that the cinematography is referenced elsewhere, too.  For instance, Michael Jackson's <i>Bad</i> video is much more enjoyable if you recognize the homage it pays to these gang scenes.</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>Back to the Future</h5> <h6>The time traveling trilogy.  Riveting and clever.  How could I not include this on a list of cultural references?  Hello, McFly!</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</h5> <h6>Bueller?  Bueller?  This shows up in lots of places, according to the IMDB.  The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, waistoids, dweebies, dickheads - they all adore him.  Oh, Yeah.</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>Fame</h5> <h6>I'm gonna live forever! Before there were teen movies, there was Fame.  You can't be a serious musician without watching this flick.</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>The Family Man</h5> <h6>Finally, a perfect role for Nicholas Cage.  How can you only think you're happy?</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>Sixteen Candles</h5> <h6>One of the two definitive teen movies.  Incorporating <i>Peter Gunn</i>.  Why is Molly Ringwald always in these?</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>Mrs. Doubtfire</h5> <h6>Robin Williams is a cultural reference on his own.  The message about parenthood and relationships is wrapped in enough funny to go down easily.</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>L.A. Story</h5> <h6>I'll have a half double decaffeinated half-caf, with a twist of lemon.  About this time, I really started liking Steve Martin; he stopped doing stupid films and started doing insightful satire.  This one is funny enough for the kids to enjoy, too.</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>Big</h5> <h6>Now here's something the kids can get into.  With insights into the adult world they're going to enter soon.</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>Toys</h5> <h6>Although it was surreal, the music was fantastic.  And it had a message that the kids should learn.</h6>
</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>
<h5>Liar Liar</h5> <h6>I wish, just for one day... Well, we've all done it.  Although this is fantastically funny, it's probably more for the adults than the kids.  Even the message is lost on the children.</h6>
</li>&#13;
