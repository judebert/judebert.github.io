<p>Eri has to attend a wedding shower in New Jersey in a couple of days, so she bought a one-way plane ticket.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
"One way?"  I hear you cry.  Yes, one way.  Who in the world wants to deal with the airlines more than necessary?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
That left things wide open for a family vacation.  The plan is for all of us to leave today, drop Eri off at the airport, and then drive up the Eastern Seaboard doing touristy things until we pick her up.  (She'll take a train to either Lancaster, PA or Washington, DC, depending on how things work out.)  Then we'll go find snow, then return home.  10 days altogether -- my first real vacation in <b>eight years</b>.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
A friend of mine named Ron lives in North Carolina, near where I grew up.  With luck, we'll get to see him and his family for the first time in five years -- not to mention my old stomping grounds -- on our way back down.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Meanwhile, I'm traveling with three little girls in the van.  As Ron says, if I end the trip with the same three girls I started with, I'll be doing pretty good.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<h3>Day 1</h3><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
We dropped Eri off at the airport.  The girls were a little teary-eyed, except for Kayla, our youngest.  She cried.  She's just 5, and she doesn't really understand what's going on.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Melissa got a camera for Christmas; a nice, 5 mega-pixel Kodak that was deliberately chosen for this purpose.  Unfortunately, its batteries died, so we have no pictures of Mommy saying goodbye.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I told Kayla that one of the planes taking off was Mommy's plane so she could say good-bye and direct her attention to the travel at hand.  This was not completely honest, but it wasn't all that bad either.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The trip started poorly; I went the wrong way and had to drive all the way around the airport.  I was running on fumes, too.  Melissa tried to take some pictures of beautiful early-morning landscapes, but they mostly came out blurry.  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/judebert/">Here's a Flickr set of the first day, available while I get stuff uploaded to my website.</a>&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I let the girls watch DVDs on this leg of the trip.  The two DVD players were also Christmas gifts deliberately chosen for this purpose.  Santa gave them to the family.  We also received a few DVDs, including <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0427327/">Hairspray</a>, one of my favorite movies.  The kids love it too; they watched it multiple times.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
That worked up until we reached the dealership.  We had planned to have our passenger side front turn signal replaced, and they had it done in 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, the rear hatch handle had broken the previous night, too.  Luckily, they replaced that in just about an hour and we were on our way!  We traveled hard and ate lunch at a drive-through to make up for the lost time.  My "wheel pressure low" light started going off, but it always does that after we visit the dealership.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We finally stopped at the South Carolina welcome center.  The kids took pictures there, but I haven't got the faintest idea why.  It was their first trip, and the first time they had seen a welcome center, but I never considered them all that impressive.  You can see the kids were fixated on the dead trees (we don't get many of those in Florida) and the new birds.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The camera was brought out again when we reached our first "roller coaster hill".  We don't get many of those in Florida, either.  The kids were quite impressed by this; I can't wait to see what they think about the real mountains.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We had hotel reservations in North Carolina.  We stopped at the welcome center, of course, and the kids celebrated being out of the car with races and cartwheels.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Since we were in North Carolina, we had to try the barbecue.  The kids loved it.  Kayla especially liked the big concrete pig statues outside the restaurant.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
They were also impressed with the cold, although it's hard to take pictures of that.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Finally we reached our hotel, a Microtel.  I organized the kids and got them to carry their own luggage.  I've been touting a new family philosophy during this whole trip: "We all work together to make everybody happy."  It's working so far.  Can it last for ten days?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
There was a cat outside in a little tent cube.  He seemed content.  He didn't appear to leave his cube the whole time were there.  The room was very cool: it had two beds and a window seat.  The window seat was immediately put to use as a bed.  I managed to get everything calmed down, then put them to bed.  Then I went downstairs to upload the pictures.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So ended Day 1.  I've still got the same kids, and I'm not frustrated or anything.  If I can keep everybody working together, we'll have a great time.&#13;
