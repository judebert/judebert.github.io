<p>Eri only bought a one-way ticket to her wedding shower in New Jersey.  That meant the rest of us had to go pick her up.  How will one dad fare in a minivan with his wife and three kids?&#13;
</p>&#13;
<h3>Day 4</h3>&#13;
<p>We had some trouble getting out of the Clarion Inn and Fun Dome this morning, predictably enough.  The kids enjoyed their Free Continental Breakfast, then played shuffleboard and minigolf, even buying a game of billiards (which is what really slowed us down).&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We left about an hour later than planned.  We planned to go take an Amish buggy ride in Lancaster, then head to Hershey, Pennsylvania for New Year's Eve.  We couldn't exactly leave the kids in the hotel room and go watch them lift the giant Kiss, but surely they'd cover it on local TV.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>We made it to Lancaster around lunchtime.  Lancaster was nice, but bigger than expected.  After lunch at an buffet with "authentic Amish food", it took longer to get to our buggy ride than expected.  As a family of five, we had to wait for one of the big two-horse buggies.  While we waited, I played freeze tag with the kids, and used horse carts for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punchbuggy">Punchbuggy</a>.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The buggy ride was difficult and unrewarding.  Kayla wouldn't sit still (not a big surprise).  Our driver, Menno, was happy to answer questions, but not very forthcoming.  I wanted the kids to understand why the Amish don't use electricity, but when I asked, the best he would provide was, "We like to live a slower-paced kind of life."  That didn't provide much of a base to build on when Eri asked why they occasionally use solar panels.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
He also described the Mennonites as "a more modern Amish", but wouldn't explain why the Mennonite - Amish schizm had occurred.  He did provide a date -- 1862 -- but that was long before electrical lights and appliances became widespread.  What was the schizm about, and how did the groups differ now?  "The Mennonites are a more modern kind of Amish."&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The buggy ride didn't even go past any Amish houses.  We decided that we'd been ripped off, and we didn't want to visit the big building next door with Amish goods for sale.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We tried to visit the Amish village, but it's not open at this time of year, probably due to cold.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Instead, we visited the Target.  We found gloves, jackets, and everything else we would need to play in the snow.  By this time, it was dark; we headed to Hershey.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Along the way, we saw snow on the shoulders and the sides of the parking lots.  The kids were ecstatic!  The roads were clear, but I slowed down anyway.  After all, this was a Florida car.  It had all-weather tires, not snow tires.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The hotel in Hershey was fantastic.  Expensive, but big.  We unpacked, started a load of laundry, and ordered pizza to be delivered.  While we waited, I went outside to play in the "snow" with the kids.  This was largely the mounds piled up by the snowplow, but there was a half-inch on the grass.  We tossed "snowballs" into the frozen drainage pond, skittering across the surface or breaking through.  Then we went in to eat.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
One by one the kids fell asleep until it was just me, Eri, and Tatiana.  We checked out the local news, but nobody covered the Kiss.  We completely missed it.  They did set off a fireworks display we could see (and hear) from our hotel room; that was pretty cool.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
A reasonably disappointing day.  But we're one step closer to our goal: a family snow vacation.&#13;
