<p>&#13;
Since there's never been an American wizard, I figured it was fertile ground for a Wushu RPG adventure with my kids.  And a nice reward for cleaning up the dining room table.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The Dark wizards -- the ones who refused to refute the Dark Lord, and managed to escape -- have all fled to the safety of magical desolation.  In other words, they invaded America.  They're just waiting for an opportunity to rebuild their influence and get their fair share.  They expected a fairly tranquil exile, but there's no rest for the wicked.  Literally: they find themselves troubled by dreams wherein they are expelled from their new homes by a magical force too powerful for them to resist.  But the mysterious power is undirected, unfocused.   &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Using Legilimency, the Dark wizard Soren tries to find the source of the dreams.  He is astounded when he discovers that the source is the first American wizard!  He continues probing, and finds why the power has no direction: it is wielded by a 7-year-old girl!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Unfortunately, his Legilimency has given poor Carina nightmares of a dark nothingness enveloping everything she knows and loves.  She runs to her parents' room, startling them awake with the bright glow coming from all around her.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
The glow fades quickly, but Carina can tell her parents are disturbed.  They let her sleep in their bed that evening, but she is restless; she wakes multiple times during the night, only to hear them talking quietly by the computer, trying to find a scientific explanation.  Nothing in medicine or science can account for it.  In the end they decide it must have been an illusion caused by the neighbor turning on a light, perhaps going to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Carina is so tired from her sleepless night that the next day, while watching television with her sisters Melissa and Tatiana, she falls asleep on the couch.  And it happens again: Soren tries to touch her, she has a nightmare of darkness, and she produces a glow so bright it can be seen in daytime.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Faced with this evidence, their parents are at a loss.  Should they take Carina out of school?  Continue as if nothing is wrong?  Seek medical help?  They decide nothing <i>is</i> wrong; after all, these "incidents" don't seem to be hurting Carina (beyond the nightmares and lack of sleep). &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
REVISION: Maybe just start with Carina, and let this all be discovered later?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Carina and her two sisters are kidnapped by goons while the parents are out on a date.  The goons can't tell which one they want.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The sisters escape from the complex where they are being held into a wilderness.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The sisters come to a town, where an Indian seems to recognize Carina's magical potential.  He sends them to the "stick indians" -- the Sasquatch.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The Sasquatch surround the girls in the forest.  Recognizing Carina's magical potential, they invite the girls to stay with them while they train Carina.  They give Melissa a bow of bone with arrows that never miss, which once belonged to Snow Rabbit.  They give Tatiana a "jacket of need", with pockets that will always produce exactly what she needs -- just maybe not what she wants.  She gets new batteries for her GPS to see if it works.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The Sasquatch explain that magic is actually controlled by dark matter; since it doesn't interact electromagnetically, it can't be seen or touched.  But it does interact with gravity.  Carina's brain is configured with folds that enhance gravity, allowing her to interact with dark matter.  She just needs control.  (Begin training montage.)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Tatiana eventually gets her iPhone working with a satellite.  The news indicates that their parents are the prime suspects in the girls' disappearance.  The girls return home to clear their parents of any wrongdoing.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Soren is waiting there.  The girls fight him, but fail to dispose of him permanently.  &#13;
