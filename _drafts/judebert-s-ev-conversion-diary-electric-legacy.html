<p>&#13;
While I sat in my office this morning, just taking care of email and such forth, a coworker gave me some startling news: he was using my EV parking space.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I figured he was apologizing for parking his gas guzzler there, and I told him I didn't blame him: when I asked for the space, I specified "anywhere convenient; the back corner of the parking lot would be fine", but SAIC gave me the best space in the facility.  With my batteries dead for lo, this past year (?), I was surprised they hadn't taken the sign down.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
BUT NO!  Inspired by my example, he had purchased a <a href="http://www.zeromotorcycles.com/zero-s/">Zero S electric motorcycle!</a>  (It's a lithium-ion powered bike without any transmission.) He travels 38 miles each way, and he'd always had range anxiety, but "my" electric charging space gave him the confidence to go for the EV grin.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
During the ensuing chat, he told me how happy he is with his bike, how he's saving so much money (compared to taking his ICE pickup truck) that the bike will essentially be free after three years, that he actually took classes to get a motorcycle license... and that I could personally claim credit for his conversion to electric driving.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
And so I will!  Even if Silent E isn't running today, even if I can never get the new batteries I want for her, I still have an electric legacy: I inspired (at least one of) the people of Central Florida to drive electric!&#13;
