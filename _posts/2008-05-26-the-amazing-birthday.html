  content: HI! I was very interested in seeing your amazing race party documents,
    but when i opened them it was just a whole bunch of random letters. Is there any
    way you could e-mail them in a microsoft word format? Thanks-Lauren, laurenroxmysox@gmail.com

  content: "Lauren, I'd love to help you out, but I'm a little busy with development
    at the moment.  Additionally, saving as Microsoft Word often messes up fonts and
    things.\r\n\r\nHowever, it isn't too hard to get the files and use them.  Install
    OpenOffice -- it's free!  And it does everything Microsoft Office does.  Use your
    browser's shift-click or \"Save target as...\" option to download the files (if
    you just click, it'll try to view them in the browser, and you'll just see a bunch
    of random characters).  Then use OpenOffice to open the saved files, and voila!
    \ Amazing Race cards."

Melissa has a family reputation of picking neat birthday parties.  For instance, her 6th birthday was held at the Ponce Inlet Lighthouse.  (Cheap, easy, and memorable -- and all I had to do was escort a bunch of kids up the stairs!)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
This year, she wanted a birthday based on <i>The Amazing Race</i>.  That was quite a bit harder than the lighthouse birthday; Eri and I spent more than a week putting everything together, and visited the park three times to make sure we got it all right.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Everyone had loads of fun, and I doubt anyone will forget this birthday.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Of course I used OpenOffice to create the clues and such.  I based them off the clues from TV and the Internet.  You're welcome to use my documents as a template if you like.  Of course, my clues are one full page each, not one-third page like the real race.  And they're a little plain, as I didn't have time to put in all the swooshy overlay stuff.  But everybody loved them anyway.&#13;
