<p>
Two people have told me that my site is having problems -- one through the Serendipity forums, and one through email.  Of course, if two people actually took the time to tell me, I have to wonder how many are just leaving without saying anything!
</p><p>
The odd thing is that I check the site multiple times daily, from two different locations.  I haven't had any trouble at all.
</p><p>
The other odd thing is that I replied to the email, but it bounced back!  Could be a scam, I suppose... but just in case: <b>Sylvia</b>, I'm not ignoring you.  Your server rejected my reply because it didn't recognize your email.
