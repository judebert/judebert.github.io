A while back, I said a little bit about <a href="/progress/politics/Intolerant-Politics.html">Intolerant Politics</a>.  Here's a practical example.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I should have predicted this; it would have been simple enough, but I was too busy making my point to think that far in the future.  With hindsight, I can at least say: I'm glad we didn't get the interior window decal.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Pause to consider that for a moment.  Someone was frustrated and angry enough to violently destroy my property... and they know where I live.  They may know who my children are.  Should I let my kids bike to school this morning?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Melissa's school is largely McCain supporters.  They've been saying terrible things about Obama.  How are they going to act this morning?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
This is what happens when we categorize and vilify people, instead of <i>making plans</i>.  We wind up making effigies of our opponents, which makes it impossible to accept them.  Then we extend those characterizations to their supporters.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
To attempt the foresight I skipped in the earlier article, I must wonder where all this will lead.  Obama has been thoroughly dehumanized for many McCain supporters.  If they cannot accept him as president, what will they do?  Leave the country?  I don't think so.  It's more likely we'll see some attempts at violence.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We can't claim to be a great nation when half the people can't tolerate the other half.  We can't achieve our great goals when half the people refuse to participate, or actively oppose us.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
To be a great country, we need to be a complete country.  We must go farther than tolerance: we must respect those who differ from us.  Even those who oppose us.  &#13;
