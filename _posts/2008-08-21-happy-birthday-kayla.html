<p>Kayla turns 6 today!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Despite the "hurricane" stalled overhead, we had the room decorated and a big pile of presents ready for her to open when she woke up.  She was thrilled with the presents, which included a new table and chairs (from Omi and Opi), a beautiful rug (from Mommy and Daddy), paint pots and brushes (from Melissa), and a teddy bear (from Tatiana).  I don't intend to list all the presents or anything; she was happy to turn 6, and everybody got a big hug.&#13;

She didn't want to go to school, but we took her anyway.  When she comes home, she can clean up her room and give away enough old stuff to fit the new stuff in.&#13;

Happy Birthday, Kayla!&#13;
