    bucks) that feeds into my Linux based entertainment PC to help solve these types

Since my garage door broke several weeks ago, I've been parking the Silent E outside.  Eri has been concerned that someone will steal my extension cord, since it's a really nice version I paid some extra money for.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But we live in a nice neighborhood, so we haven't had any problems with that.  Instead, somebody's been unplugging my car.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It's happened 3 times now.  I've detected each occurrence with plenty of time to correct the problem, but it's still a little disturbing.  The big question is, "Why?"  Does someone just hate EVs?  Is someone jealous?  Is my charger or fan making a noise that's driving someone crazy?  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Or is a squirrel trying to climb the wire and pulling it free?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
If I had enough money, I'd set up a little camera to watch the car.  The cheap, low-tech solution is to just tie a knot in the cord; at least that'll deter anyone who isn't actually upset.&#13;
