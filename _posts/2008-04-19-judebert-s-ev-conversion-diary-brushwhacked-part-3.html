  <figcaption>What's wrong with this picture?</figcaption>
</figure><p>This has been one of the most frustrating weeks of my life.  I know I've got to get the car rolling, at least for a week or two, so the bigwigs at work don't think they've wasted their time and money putting in a charging space.  I've got a plan to get <i>Silent E</i> back on his feet.
</p><p>
But I can't get anything done!  All week we've had activities scheduled that get in the way.
</p><p>
<i>Update 2008-05-01: embarrasing pictures.</i>
</p><a id="extended"></a><p> Monday and Tuesday I teach Math Superstars, so I had to work late to make up hours.  Tuesday, Tatiana played Curious George at the book fair, and we didn't make any good family plans, so I had to take over and make sure everyone got fed.  (Tatiana had a blast!)  I also managed to get to Ace, but they were out of 8mm x 1.25 taps.
</p><p>
In despair, desperate to make progress, I ordered two new brushes and two spares from EVParts.com.  Of course, to get them by Saturday, I needed to order them by Express Mail.  Shipping cost slightly more than the four brushes.
</p><p>
Thursday Eri chaperoned the 7th grade field trip, despite feeling sick, and plans went all to rubbish again.  I managed to find an Ace with a tap, though.  Friday Eri was fully diseased, Melissa caught it, Kayla came home with pinkeye, and I had to work late to make up all the hours I'd missed.  But EVParts came through: the brushes had been delivered practically overnight!
</p><p>
Today I had to take care of sickies.  I wanted a full day, but I didn't even get started until 5PM.  I tapped the full-size bolt hole, then started on the the midget hole.

  <figcaption>Go ahead, stare.  Get it over with.</figcaption>

<p>
I broke the tap off in the hole.  The world is against me.
</p><p>
Frustrated beyond forbearance, I installed the new brushes, just to <b>prove</b> that I wasn't beaten.  I'm going to call Jim Husted and ask him if I can run the brushes with just three bolts.  Otherwise, I don't know what I can do.  How do you drill through a tap?
