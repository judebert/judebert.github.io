<p>Usually Fark is uninformed, but funny.  This morning, however, I happened to find a link <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-op.chapman22may22,0,3315016.story">debunking the fear preventing decriminalization of drugs</a>.  Well, okay, more than fear may be preventing us from decriminalizing -- or even legalizing -- currently-illicit substances.  But as a Libertarian, drug laws have always bothered me, especially when we wind up putting people in jail for smoking a single joint.  &#13;

Now I've got to go do some homework on the cited statistics.  Like I didn't have enough to do already.  </p>
