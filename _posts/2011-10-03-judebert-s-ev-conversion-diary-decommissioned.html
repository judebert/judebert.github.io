  content: " I wouldn't have decommissioned Silent E without another way to get to
    work. About three weeks ago, Dad sold me his motor scooter, The Red Devil. It's
    a red 1995 Honda Elite SR, model number SA50. It's got a 50cc two-stroke motor,
    and its top speed "

I still haven't fixed the batteries, and insurance is expensive, so...&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Today we decommissioned Silent E.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'm saving up for a lithium-ion pack.  Maybe I can get some of those <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2011/09/23/better-li-ion-batteries/">new ones, with the polymer anode, that store six times the energy</a>.  That would be awesome.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I haven't turned in the plate yet, but we've cancelled the insurance.  Yes, <i>I</i> "Killed the Electric Car".  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
BUT!  She will rise again!&#13;
