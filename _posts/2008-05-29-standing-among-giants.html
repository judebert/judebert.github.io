I've been volunteering at the elementary school my Kindergartener and 4th grader attend.  I serve on the School Advisory Committee, and I dress up as a wizard to teach Math Superstars.  (I use an old Halloween hat and my graduation robe).&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Volunteers in Seminole County are called "Dividends".  Today they held the Dividend Luncheon.  I was my school's Dividend of the Year, which is one of the <a href="http://www.jeffersonawards.org/">Jefferson Awards</a>!  (I got a pin and a certificate signed by four Senators!)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
They also honored the Dividends who have contributed 500, 1000, and 5000 hours.  Next to them, I felt like a phony: I've done less than 100 hours.  They actually earned the free lunch; I just put on a silly costume and got noticed.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Even more humbling, several of the Dividends who won the Dividend of the Year for their schools were students -- not just high school students, but middle school students!  To volunteer while keeping a busy school schedule demonstrates great dedication.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I was truly honored to be among such remarkable citizens and inspiring people.&#13;
