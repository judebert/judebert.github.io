Yes, we let the kids stay up late to see the lunar eclipse.  Of course!  It's the last one for nearly three years!  We're determined to keep reminding Kayla so she doesn't forget; this kind of thing rolls off a five year old's memory very easily.&#13;

As you can see from the very blurry picture, they behaved perfectly, despite the lateness of the hour.  They shared the two pairs of binoculars, the blanket, and the cat with no whining or complaining.  &#13;

They were a little crabby this morning, but I think it was well worth it.&#13;
