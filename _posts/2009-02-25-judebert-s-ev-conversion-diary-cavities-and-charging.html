Today Kayla went to the dentist to get her first cavity filled.  Last time I was there, I took Tatiana and Melissa in the (gas) minivan.  I asked the doctor if it was okay to charge up outside his office, and he was delighted to acquiesce.

So today, we took two cars.  Eri was driving the minivan, and I took Kayla in Silent E.  I plugged in right next to the air conditioning condenser.  The plan was to charge up while the cavity was filled, then split up: Eri would take Kayla home, and I could go straight to work.

Everything went off without a hitch.  I had plenty of energy, so I could even drive a little faster than usual.

Thanks, Dr. King!
