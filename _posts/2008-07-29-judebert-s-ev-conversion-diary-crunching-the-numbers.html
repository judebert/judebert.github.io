<p>I woke up early this morning, and Eri convinced me to make my measurement run to the gas station (irony!) in the morning instead of the evening.  I took Melissa along, and we stopped to fill up the tires.
</p><p>
The trip was a delight, and a much better test of real operation than the jaunt to the park.  After all, this time we were driving with the morning traffic, and we drove at speed much longer.  I also used the gear-shift points I figured out yesterday.
</p><p>
The gas station air hose registered about 10 PSI too low (good thing I bought a tire pressure gauge I can trust).  Melissa hurt her finger trying to work the hose, so she measured all the tires for me.
</p><p>
The only other problem was on the way home.  A big 'ol pickup pulled out in front of me.  A few seconds later, Melissa went, "Eww!  What's that smell?"
</p><p>
Gasoline exhaust!  For once, it wasn't the EV's fault. :D
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>So why call this article "Crunching the Numbers"?  Because I measured my distance and Watt-hours on the way.
</p><p>
To get to the gas station, we went 1.75 and used 560Wh.  The gas station is a little lower than my house, so this was mostly downhill.  That's about 330Wh/mile, which is better than expected.
</p><p>
To get home, we went 1.75 miles (imagine that!) and used only 540Wh.  That's uphill, including a small hill climb.  I also went faster, about 40MPH instead of 35.  But the tires had been only 22 PSI on the way there, and 40 PSI on the way home.  All told, I used about 310Wh/mile on that half of the trip.
</p><p>
Oh yes, this car can SO get to work.  
</p><p>
I plugged it in as soon as I got home.  I think I'll take it to the DIY car wash down the street later tonight and clean it up.  Then I should be ready to drive to work tomorrow.
</p><p>
By coincidence, the UCF Car Club holds its meetings on Wednesdays.  If I don't get the chance to cruise by tomorrow, I'll make an effort to go the week afterwards.
