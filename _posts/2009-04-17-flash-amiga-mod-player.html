This is neat: <a href="http://8bitboy.popforge.de/">8bitboy is a Flash program that plays Amiga mods.</a>  I owned an Amiga 3000, and there was one mod I loved and haven't heard for years.  Lately a Serendipity user had problems embedding 8bitboy in his sidebar, so I decided to take a shot at it and share my favorite mods.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The player is embedded below, and (for now) in my sidebar.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<!--
<embed width="150" height="57" quality="high" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" name="8bitboy" id="8bitboy" src="/progress/media/8bitboy/BitboyApp.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" base="/progress/media/8bitboy" />
-->&#13;
<object width="150" height="57" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" id="8bitboy" data="/progress/media/8bitboy/BitboyApp.swf">&#13;
<param name="quality" value="high" />&#13;
<param name="base" value="/progress/media/8bitboy" />&#13;
<param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" />&#13;
</object>	&#13;
<p><u>Update:</u> Stinkin' thing only loads its config file from the current directory.  Therefore it doesn't appear in detailed entry view, archive listings, author listings, category listings... only on the front page.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
<u>Update part 2:</u> N00b mistake.  Adding base="/progress/media/8bitboy" to my embed code fixed that problem.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
<u>Update 2009-04-21:</u> Used &lt;object&gt; tag instead of &lt;embed&gt; so the website would validate.&#13;
</p>
