I made this for my desktop.  It was supposed to look like Fred drew it himself, but it doesn't have the necessary transparency.  I'm figuring out how to fix that, and I still work on this once in a while. I think it captures the primary Megatokyo characters (other than Yuki, who just wouldn't fit) in characteristic poses.  
</p><p> All the art is taken from the online webcomic panels.  Bonus points for figuring out which panels it all came from; mega-bonus for suggesting a better panel! Available in 
<a href="/progress/media/art/megatokyo.jpg">jpg</a> and <a href="/progress/media/art/megatokyo.png">png</a> formats.

 Actually, that was too tough; I couldn't get all the characters in, so I decided to make a series of backgrounds.  Here you can get all the <a href="/progress/media/art/megatokyo_girls.jpg">Megatokyo girls, in jpg format</a> or in <a href="/progress/media/art/megatokyo_girls.png">png format</a>.
