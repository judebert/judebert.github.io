Perhaps it's just the writers strike, but I've never mentioned a comic strip on my website before.  And I found two that were worth looking at in this... five-week period.  I really need to read my webcomics more often.&#13;

Ozy and Millie is often a thoughtful, insightful comic.  In this strip, <a href="http://www.ozyandmillie.org/d/20071106.html">we find out that Ozy's dad can get his geek on.</a>&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
<a href="http://xkcd.com/327/">And this XKCD is fantastic for any SQL/web geek.</a>  Be sure to read the tooltip, too.&#13;
