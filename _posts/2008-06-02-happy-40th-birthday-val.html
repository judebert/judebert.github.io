<p>My high school friend Valerie had her 40th birthday today.  Yesterday, for her party, she rented a skating rink.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
<i>That</i> was a blast from the past.  There was music from the 80's that we all remembered.  We skated, we ate, we had a load of fun.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Kayla learned to skate, and by the end of the party she was doing okay.  One of her falls involved smacking her chin on the step.  That left a mark.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Tatiana only fell once, and Melissa fell two or three times.  Even Eri fell once.  I managed to get away unscathed, although I had a couple of close calls.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Maybe this is the exercise activity I've been looking for.  I'm sure sore today.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Happy Birthday, Val!&#13;
