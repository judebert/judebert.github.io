<p>&#13;
It's not everybody who can break his car every week.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I've been giving little trips to a friend's house.  I'm trying to discharge the batteries a little, so when they recharge, maybe they'll finally balance.  I'm also trying to figure out my Wh/mile, so I can estimate the range of the car.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
To do that, I've got to know how fast the motor is going, because best efficiency is around 3500-4000 RPM.  I'm skittish about trusting my calculations from the transmission gear ratios, so today I tried to hook up the tachometer.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I busted something.  It won't start.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
I could hear two clicks whenever I turned the key, but the secondary main contactor was visibly open.  I had Melissa turn the key for me while I measured resistance, and discovered that neither of the main contactors was engaging.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
However, the <b>heater</b> contactor is briefly turning on, then turning off.  I have no idea why.  It's the oddest thing.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Next time, I'll check the car's operation <i>before</i> I start to work on it, so I'll know for sure whether it was something I did or some pre-existing problem.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'm tired, sweaty, and disappointed.  I'll check this out some other time, when I have free time.&#13;
