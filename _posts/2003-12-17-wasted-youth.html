<p>&#13;
Well, I was a talented youth, full of potential. Everyone thought I'd&#13;
go far. Of course, I earned some of it. But truthfully, my parents were&#13;
pushing me to use my talents. When they were no longer available to&#13;
prod me in the proper direction, I slacked off. (That would be college,&#13;
of course.) </p><p>&#13;
So, let's play THEN and NOW.  Here's what I had <b>THEN</b>:&#13;
</p><ul id="then">&#13;
<li>Excellent schools, gifted/talented classes</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>Several summer programs, based on academic or vocal skills</li>&#13;
<li>High school track record for 800m dash</li>&#13;
<li>National Merit Scholar Semi-Finalist</li>&#13;
<li>Tied for best Florida Scholar math score</li>&#13;
<li>Selected for two vocal ensembles</li>&#13;
<li>SAT score of 1450</li>&#13;
&#13;
<li>Perfect ACT score</li>&#13;
<li>Perfect AP Calculus score</li>&#13;
<li>Full scholarship to Loyola University in New Orleans</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>&#13;
Pretty good, huh?  And what did I do with all this potential?  Here's what I've done <b>NOW</b>:&#13;
</p>&#13;
<ul id="now">&#13;
	<li>Lost scholarship after first year</li>&#13;
&#13;
	<li>Skipped classes</li>&#13;
	<li>Dropped math major, went into Computer Science</li>&#13;
	<li>Took six years to graduate college with a BS in Computer Science</li>&#13;
	<li>Became a salesman for Amiga computers</li>&#13;
	<li>Went into tech support</li>&#13;
	<li>Eventually became a full-time programmer/analyst</li>&#13;
&#13;
	<li>Haven't been singing in any organized group</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>&#13;
Pathetic.  I should have had the world at my feet.  I should have proven Fermat's Last Theorem by now.  My mother sighs a lot.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
My friends from the Honor classes and special programs have all become&#13;
researchers, scientists, and PhDs. They've participated in&#13;
ground-breaking discoveries and activities. They've launched Space&#13;
Shuttles, looked through the Hubble, and investigated earthquake&#13;
phenomena using supercomputers I'll never see, let alone touch. &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
They tell me that at least I have a life, as evidenced by a&#13;
family. I consider this to be patronizing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not&#13;
unhappy. I just look back at my youth and realize that I have wasted a&#13;
great deal of potential. As you can see, I have a lot to make up for. &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'm constantly coming up with interesting inventions,&#13;
program ideas, and marketing slogans. If I ever get too depressed, I'll&#13;
list them here and let them go to anybody who wants them. Until then,&#13;
I'm a huge resource of information just waiting to be utilized. Go&#13;
ahead, ask me something. &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Have you wasted your youth?  <a href="mailto:%6audebert%40judebert%2ecom">Write me</a> and give me <b>your</b> brag sheet.  If I find you to be interesting, I'll add you to the Gallery of Wasted Potential!  What an honor!  (You can also <a href="/progress/feedback.html">write me through your browser</a>.)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So you find this interesting, and you want to know more about me.  You really <em>don't</em> have anything better to do, have you?&#13;

Let's see; did I leave any personnally identifying information out?  Yes.  Good.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
As you can tell from the details above, I can't devote my whole life&#13;
to this page -- I've got a family <b>AND</b> a job.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Any pages I have will be mentioned in the Table of Contents, in order to help you navigate&#13;
faster and more easily to what you want.  Since I don't want to serve up broken links, I&#13;
can only post actual information about things I know.  Like:&#13;
</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>Programming (including networking, Java, Unix, Windows, graphics, and simulation)&#13;
	</li>
<li>Science Fiction (I like the hard SF best)&#13;
	</li>
<li>Parenting (father of three girls)&#13;
	</li>
<li>Gaming (although I hate the 3D stuff... except Descent II!)&#13;
	</li>
<li>Computers (I just built another one)&#13;
	</li>
<li>Fractals (I've got this idea for a fractal animator and morpher I know I'll get time to work on someday)&#13;
	</li>
<li>3D rendering, ray-tracing, and animation&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>&#13;
If you want information on anything I know, just <a href="mailto:%6audebert%40judebert%2ecom">&#13;
	e-mail</a> me.  I'll build a page whenever I get free time to serve up your info.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
