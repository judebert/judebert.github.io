Well, I was a talented youth, full of potential. Everyone thought I'd
go far. Of course, I earned some of it. But truthfully, my parents were
pushing me to use my talents. When they were no longer available to
prod me in the proper direction, I slacked off. (That would be college,
of course.) </p><p>
So, let's play THEN and NOW.  Here's what I had <b>THEN</b>:
</p><ul id="then">
<li>Excellent schools, gifted/talented classes</li>

<li>Several summer programs, based on academic or vocal skills</li>
<li>High school track record for 800m dash</li>
<li>National Merit Scholar Semi-Finalist</li>
<li>Tied for best Florida Scholar math score</li>
<li>Selected for two vocal ensembles</li>
<li>SAT score of 1450</li>

<li>Perfect ACT score</li>
<li>Perfect AP Calculus score</li>
<li>Full scholarship to Loyola University in New Orleans</li>
</ul>
<p>
Pretty good, huh?  And what did I do with all this potential?  Here's what I've done <b>NOW</b>:
</p>
<ul id="now">
    <li>Lost scholarship after first year</li>

    <li>Skipped classes</li>
    <li>Dropped math major, went into Computer Science</li>
    <li>Took six years to graduate college with a BS in Computer Science</li>
    <li>Became a salesman for Amiga computers</li>
    <li>Went into tech support</li>
    <li>Eventually became a full-time programmer/analyst</li>

    <li>Haven't been singing in any organized group</li>
</ul>
<p>
Pathetic.  I should have had the world at my feet.  I should have proven Fermat's Last Theorem by now.  My mother sighs a lot.
</p><p>
My friends from the Honor classes and special programs have all become
researchers, scientists, and PhDs. They've participated in
ground-breaking discoveries and activities. They've launched Space
Shuttles, looked through the Hubble, and investigated earthquake
phenomena using supercomputers I'll never see, let alone touch. 
</p><p>
They tell me that at least I have a life, as evidenced by a
family. I consider this to be patronizing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not
unhappy. I just look back at my youth and realize that I have wasted a
great deal of potential. As you can see, I have a lot to make up for. 
</p><p>
I'm constantly coming up with interesting inventions,
program ideas, and marketing slogans. If I ever get too depressed, I'll
list them here and let them go to anybody who wants them. Until then,
I'm a huge resource of information just waiting to be utilized. Go
ahead, ask me something. 
</p><p>
Have you wasted your youth?  <a href="mailto:%6audebert%40judebert%2ecom">Write me</a> and give me <b>your</b> brag sheet.  If I find you to be interesting, I'll add you to the Gallery of Wasted Potential!  What an honor!  (You can also <a href="/progress/feedback.html">write me through your browser</a>.)
</p><p>
So you find this interesting, and you want to know more about me.  You really <em>don't</em> have anything better to do, have you?

Let's see; did I leave any personnally identifying information out?  Yes.  Good.
</p><p>
As you can tell from the details above, I can't devote my whole life
to this page -- I've got a family <b>AND</b> a job.
</p><p>
Any pages I have will be mentioned in the Table of Contents, in order to help you navigate
faster and more easily to what you want.  Since I don't want to serve up broken links, I
can only post actual information about things I know.  Like:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Programming (including networking, Java, Unix, Windows, graphics, and simulation)
    </li>
<li>Science Fiction (I like the hard SF best)
    </li>
<li>Parenting (father of three girls)
    </li>
<li>Gaming (although I hate the 3D stuff... except Descent II!)
    </li>
<li>Computers (I just built another one)
    </li>
<li>Fractals (I've got this idea for a fractal animator and morpher I know I'll get time to work on someday)
    </li>
<li>3D rendering, ray-tracing, and animation
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
If you want information on anything I know, just <a href="mailto:%6audebert%40judebert%2ecom">
    e-mail</a> me.  I'll build a page whenever I get free time to serve up your info.
</p><p>
What, no e-mail?  It's not working?  Have a convenient form!  You can <a href="/progress/feedback.html">
    send me your opinions right from your browser</a>.
