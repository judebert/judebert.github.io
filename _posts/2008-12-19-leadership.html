<p>I was just reading this <a href="http://www.battleofideas.org.uk/index.php/site/battles/2224/">fantastic treatise on the meaning of "leadership"</a> online.  It was worth every moment I spent on it.  It makes me wonder if I actually have any talent in leadership.

It contains some political, historical, and literary references, mostly British.  A recommended read for anyone over the age of 13.
