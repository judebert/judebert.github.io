I must be doing something right: my eldest daughter went to a sleepover at a friend's house.  They wanted to play Sims 3, but the computer wasn't working.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We had discussed this earlier, so she new it didn't have the appropriate drivers.  She and her friend <b>took the computer apart</b> to figure out what model of motherboard they were dealing with, then put it back together, downloaded the appropriate drivers, and got everything running.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Alright, it took them 3 hours.  But that's not bad for a first time.  And they treated a difficult problem with perseverance and initiative.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Alpha Geek approves.  Well done, Grasshopper!&#13;
