I must be doing something right: my eldest daughter went to a sleepover at a friend's house.  They wanted to play Sims 3, but the computer wasn't working.
</p><p>
We had discussed this earlier, so she knew it didn't have the appropriate drivers.  She and her friend <b>took the computer apart</b> to figure out what model of motherboard they were dealing with, then put it back together, downloaded the appropriate drivers, and got everything running.
</p><p>
Alright, it took them 3 hours.  But that's not bad for a first time.  And they treated a difficult problem with perseverance and initiative.
</p><p>
Alpha Geek approves.  Well done, Grasshopper!
