What do a <a href="/progress/permalink/2012-UCF-SDS-1.html">plasma-guided rocket</a>, <a href="/progress/permalink/2012-UCF-SDS-2.html">aerodynamic bicycle farings</a>, a <a href="/progress/permalink/2012-UCF-SDS-3.html">life-size remote control and motion base</a>, and an <a href="/progress/permalink/2012-UCF-SDS-4.html">SUV car wash</a> have in common?  No, not that, get your head out of the gutter!  ;-)
</p><p>  I got to see them all at the <acronym title="UCF College of Engineering and Computer Science Annual Senior Design Symposium on Renewable and Sustainable Energy">SDS</acronym> and talk to the students who created them!
</p><p>
Today I'm returning to my environmental roots with an auto-adjusting solar collector and an autonomous oil skimmer.

It seems there's a solar trough at every <acronym title="UCF College of Engineering and Computer Science Annual Senior Design Symposium on Renewable and Sustainable Energy">SDS</acronym>.  One year it was designed to be made and used in impoverished countries, so it was built from oil drums and other readily available materials.  
</p><p>
This year's solar collecting trough was much more sophisticated.  All the usual characteristics were there: custom-designed parabola, special reflective film, custom mounting.  Everything was done in metal; the parabola was too big for the student machine shop, so they had to redesign it in multiple pieces.
</p><p>
The real standout was the automatic guidance.  If you look <b>really</b> closely at the tangle of wire and cardboard above, you'll see a photo-resistor on the cardboard divider.  There's another one just like it on the other side.  One of the students made a voltage divider that compares the two; the motor then rotates the mirror until both photo-resistors have the same voltage: the solar trough is pointing directly at the sun.
</p><p>
It's a cheap, easy method for keeping the collector as efficient as possible.  It could be applied to photovoltaic solar cells, too.  
</p><p>
Since they designed it to be installed on a roof in Florida, they also added a safety feature: when the wind is going to reach hurricane strength, the owner can flick a switch and the motor will turn the solar trough upside-down.  Its parabolic bottom will be exposed, protecting the reflective surface and the electronics.  It also becomes more aerodynamic: less sail-like, more wing-like.  It can withstand Category 3 hurricane winds with no damage.

This little gem is an autonomous oil-skimmer.  I'm always surprised, especially in a political season, how short some people's memories can be.  These students remembered the Exxon Valdez and the big BP Horizon oil spill.  And they designed this.
</p><p>
It's extremely light: about five pounds altogether.  The body serves as both a flotation hull and an oil container.  The solar panel recharges a battery that turns the big yellow drum at the front.  The motion draws in water, propelling the craft <b><i>very slowly</i></b> forward; a rudder in the back (not currently attached) guides it.
</p><p>
The drum is simultaneously hydrophobic (water-repelling) and oil-philic (oil-attracting).  It skims the oil off the water, clinging to the drum, where it gets scraped off by a <i>plastic ruler</i> just after the top.  The oil runs down a channel to the back, where it's stored.
</p><p>
A small computer and GPS receiver guides the craft.  When it fills up with one gallon of oil, it automatically returns to a collection point, where it's picked up and emptied.  
</p><p>
The whole thing can be air-dropped by the thousands.  Working together, they could clean up any oil spill.
</p><p>
The only problem is stability: on the open sea, they're very stable front-to-back, but not so much side-to-side.  They're considering adding a pontoon.  I recommended simply attaching three of them together in a triangle, since they're meant to be used in groups anyway.
