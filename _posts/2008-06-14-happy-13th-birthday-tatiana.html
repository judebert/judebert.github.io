Yes, Tatiana had her 13th birthday on Friday the 13th.  We set up a "Spooky Sleepover" for her party: a dozen girls dressed in "spooky" costumes.  We had witches, black cats, a ninja, and a Titanic victim.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We played Murder in the Dark, had a scavenger hunt, and ate lots of snacks and pizza.  &#13;

Happy Birthday, Tatiana!&#13;
