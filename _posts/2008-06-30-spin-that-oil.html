I've been subscribed to Republican fund-raising newsletters for some time now.  I suppose that's what happens when you write to your senator, asking him nicely to stop effing things up.  Maybe it was from the petition I signed, or the survey I filled out.
</p><p>
Usually they're fear-mongering claptrap.  "Those tax-and-spend Democrats are trying to create a filibuster-proof supermajority in the Congress so they can give eleventy-seven QUAZILLION DOLLARS to the terrorists, and they'll succeed in their mad plan to DESTROY AMERICA if you don't donate $60 to the Republican party now!"  Sometimes it's about how everybody can see right through {Democratic candidate}'s misguided / idiotic / self-serving / money-grubbing rhetoric, but our upstanding Republican hero needs my money to get elected in {completely unrelated state}.
</p><p>
They sent me a doozy this time, and I just had to share (their emphasis, not mine; and I also like the way that their emphasis stopped just short of "nuclear".  They want me to pay attention to the words they think I want to hear, not the ones that might turn me off):
</p><blockquote>
We <u>Republicans believe the key to our future is sensible exploration of our own oil resources and an expanded commitment to alternative forms of energy</u>, like nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal and hydrogen power.
</blockquote>
<p>
Just like President Bush has been <b>actively opposing</b> for the past eight years!  I especially like how they're letting the solar tax incentive expire this year; that should expand our commitment to alternative forms of energy.  I'm also fond of the big tax breaks they gave SUVs, and the way they changed it a few years ago to include the biggest cars ever made, but exclude hybrids.  Oh, yeah!  The way that converting to an electric car has <b>NO</b> incentives is motivating, too!
</p><p>
I'm sure their perfectly sane plan to drill for oil off the coast of Florida will have gas prices down to practically nothing soon.  Wait, what?  <a href="http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/052508/opl_282199506.shtml">It won't produce any oil for at least 7 years, the only oil we've ever found is low-grade, and we don't have enough refineries to do anything with it?</a>  Money well spent!  
</p><p>
But surely McCain's $300 million battery prize shows the necessary commitment.  What's that?  <a href="http://www.evworld.com/blogs/index.cfm?page=blogentry&amp;authorid=51&amp;blogid=104">The batteries exist already, but a single <i>oil</i> company holds the patent and won't let anyone produce batteries useful for anything bigger than a flashlight?</a>  Give 'em the reward, they deserve it!  
</p><p>
It's almost like the Republicans are trying to throw the race.  And that makes me nervous; I mean, we know there's a huge mess to be cleaned up, but this could indicate that there's a huge bomb hidden somewhere in the middle of it, just waiting for the next president to find it.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, my electric car is crippled for lack of affordable batteries.  I guess we'd better start drilling for oil off the coast!
