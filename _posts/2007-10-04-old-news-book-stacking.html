<p>Still catching up.  From last year, no less!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I found these photos on my Treo.  They're from a creativity activity that we did in my middle daughter's gifted class.  We were there for an orientation.  The task was simple: using only one sheet of paper, and this little bit of tape, build something to hold a stack of books at least one inch above the ground.  But the results were spectacular, especially from the viewpoint of an 8 year old girl!&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
I should have taken a picture of the support we came up with.  Melissa and I talked for a while about strong geometry (triangles) while Eri complained that I was giving too much away.  I disagreed, but I tried to hold back a little more.  Melissa experimented with a few ideas, eventually coming up with a cylinder she liked.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We built them by wrapping a 1.25" strip of paper around a fat pencil.  Since the more of them we had, the stronger the structure would be, we decided that a whole forest of the little cylinders would be ideal, but we didn't have enough paper for that.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Melissa decided to group them in packs of three, wrapped around with the tape to keep them together.  We made four quite-similar "columns" to hold up the books.&#13;
</p>&#13;

</a>&#13;
<p>Melissa set up the columns and placed a few books on top.</p>&#13;
<br style="clear: both;" />&#13;
<a class="serendipity_image_link" href="/progress/media/photos/Stack04.jpg" target="_blank">

</a>&#13;
<p>At this point, we had achieved the record.  And the columns weren't even showing the first sign of stress!</p>&#13;

</a>&#13;
<p>Eventually, it was big enough to try some trick photography.  It was as big as Melissa herself!</p>&#13;

<a class="serendipity_image_link" href="/progress/media/photos/Stack11.jpg" target="_blank">

</a>&#13;
<p>Melissa was supposed to stack the books by herself, but the tower was getting so tall she couldn't reach!  The stacking was definitely a little haphazard at this point.  We were running out of books, too.  And time; the orientation was over.  But we wouldn't let any of that stop us.</p>&#13;
<br style="clear: both;" />&#13;
<a class="serendipity_image_link" href="/progress/media/photos/Stack12.jpg" target="_blank">
<!-- s9ymdb:603 -->
  <img width="110" height="83" style="float: left; border: 0px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;" src="/progress/media/photos/Stack12.s9yThumb.jpg" alt="" />
</a>&#13;
<p>The teacher had to help out, partly for time's sake.  But mostly because Melissa just couldn't reach the top any more!  You can tell how excited she is.</p>&#13;
<br style="clear: both;" />&#13;
<a class="serendipity_image_link" href="/progress/media/photos/Stack13.jpg" target="_blank">

</a>&#13;
<p>Finally, as the teacher was trying to add a stack of printer paper, the tower fell. Not because the columns collapsed, though: the tower was unbalanced due to hasty construction and flexible building materials.</p>  &#13;
<br style="clear: both;" />&#13;

</a>&#13;
<p>And of course, it made a gigantic mess we had to clean up.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
A fantastic day, and a lot of fun!  Melissa will certainly never forget it!&#13;
