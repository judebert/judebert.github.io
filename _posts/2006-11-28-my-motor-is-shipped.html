  content: Worth every penny, Jim.  And if you think this is something, you should
    see <a href="http://judebert.com/progress/archives/120-Judeberts-EV-Conversion-Diary-Motor-is-Fixed.html">the
    post where I actually received the motor</a>!

<p>Jim just wrote me to say that he shipped my motor!  He had some shipping problems I didn't, though...</p><a id="extended"></a><p>He used <a href="http://www.dhl-usa.com/home/home.asp">DHL</a>, just like I did; they're a nice, fast shipping service at a reasonable price.  (No, I don't get any money for saying so, more's the pity.)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
<b>Where's my motor?</b>  If you want to track a shipment, you have to visit their <a href="http://track.dhl-usa.com/TrackByNbr.asp?nav=TrackBynumber">web form</a> and type in the tracking number -- 25781350641 -- because they don't let you make a nice URL you can give your site visitors.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I mentioned Jim had some trouble.  Here's what he said:&#13;
</p><blockquote>&#13;
I don't know how you shipped this out.  I had it boxed&#13;
with the hub inside and she weighed 160 lbs. which was&#13;
10 lbs over their limit.  I had to get a smaller box&#13;
and redo it.  I had to remove the hub and will have to&#13;
ship it seperatly as it came to 150 lbs even as it&#13;
was.&#13;
</blockquote><p>&#13;
Come to think of it, I didn't have a complete motor in there.  There's probably 10 pounds or more of debris in a paper bag in my garage right now.  I hope it didn't increase the shipping cost much.  If it did, I'll be happy to make up the difference.&#13;
</p><blockquote>&#13;
Anyway I wanted to let you know she's coming at&#13;
you.  Thanks so much for trusting me with your baby.&#13;
</blockquote><p>&#13;
Jim, you da man.  You know it, I know it, everybody says it.  I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get my motor rebuilt by <a href="http://www.hitorqueelectric.com/">HiTorque Electric!</a>  Thanks so much for helping me out!&#13;
