<p>
I've been swamped with family stuff for a couple of weeks; very little has gotten done on the EV.  Nathan came over Saturday to fix that.  He did make some progress, but not as much as he'd hoped.
</p><p>
He also left behind a trail of stuff that needed attention over the week.  I just ruined my favorite shirt taking care of it.
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>
During the week, I'd ground out a small aluminum block to use as a secondary bracket.  It's just supposed to attach to the second motor mount hole and help keep the big bracket well-anchored vertically.  With counter-sunk Allen bolts, it would look pretty sly.
</p><p>
<a href="/progress/EV/BrushWhacked6.html">Apparently, I can't hold a grinder straight.</a>  My block has tilted edges.  
</p><p>
I did manage to get the 1/2" hold on top drilled.  It took a trip to the hardware store to buy a tool sharpener, though.
</p><p>
Nathan came over and tapped the 1/2" hole, installed the chunk (<a href="/progress/EV/BrushWhacked5.html">so it would be in the <b>installed</b> position</a>), and drilled the holes for the 3/8" Allen bolts.  Then he took it off and drilled the countersink holes.
</p><p>
Yes, the bottom of the hole was a funnel, and yes, the Allen bolts have flat heads.  It's not like this is all THAT important.  It'd still work.
</p><p>
But the Allen bolts have 9/16" heads, and the biggest bit that will fit in my 3/8" drill is a 1/2" bit.  
</p><p>
I found an extra broken bit when I came back.  And the drill was stuck so the bit in it wouldn't come out.  Apparently Nathan had some tool trouble, too.
</p><p>
Not daunted, he decided to re-insert the passenger axle.  But he couldn't get it back together.  <a href="/progress/EV/BrushWhacked2.html">Since the axle-nut is semi-permanently affixed</a>, he just removed the whole steering knuckle and pulled it out.  One of the u-joints on the end had come apart, and he couldn't get it back together.
</p><p>
End of day.
</p><p>
That left me with four things to do: </p><ol>
<li>get a 5/8" drill bit with a 3/8" shank,</li>
<li>get the old bit out of the drill,</li>
<li>get a mechanic to remove the axle from the steering knuckle, and</li>
<li>get a new axle</li>
</ol>.
<p>
Nobody anywhere has a 5/8" drill bit with a 3/8" shank suitable for drilling aluminum, and there's not a machine shop anywhere nearby that can do the job; I'll have to get a 1/2" drill (won't Eri be pleased? :-P)  Lowe's couldn't get the bit out either; I had to leave the drill with them.  They eventually got it out; I retrieved it yesterday.  The easiest part of the whole thing has been new axle: the AutoZone down the street had one in stock for $60 + $20 core.
</p><p>
The mechanic wasn't open by the time I got to him yesterday; this morning he attacked the axle nut with a pneumatic drill he called "Big Bertha" ("450ft-pounds of torque!") and it came right off.  $20.  Unfortunately, I got grease all over my nice polo shirt.  I didn't have anything to change into, so I went to work greasy.  Ick.
</p><p>
BUT I've got almost everything we'll need to attack the problem on Saturday.
</p><p>
We'll have this thing running yet!
