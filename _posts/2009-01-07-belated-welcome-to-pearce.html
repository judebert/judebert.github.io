<p>
It occurs to me that, due to my hard drive crash, I didn't get to welcome my new nephew Pearce to Big Room.

Born 9 pounds 13 ounces (yow!) after multiple inconveniences and long suffering on the part of his mother, Pearce certainly deserves a friendly introduction to the world.

Happy Zero-Day Release, Pearce!
