<p>&#13;
It occurs to me that, due to my hard drive crash, I didn't get to welcome my new nephew Pearce to Big Room.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Born 9 pounds 13 ounces (yow!) after multiple inconveniences and long suffering on the part of his mother, Pearce certainly deserves a friendly introduction to the world.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Happy Zero-Day Release, Pearce!&#13;
