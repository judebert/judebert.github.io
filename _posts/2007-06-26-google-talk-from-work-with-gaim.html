<p>My co-worker, who works in the building across the street, uses AIM for communications.  Since we're running Linux, I tried to get Pidgin on my box.  Unfortunately, the work box is Ubuntu Dapper Drake, and it only has GAIM.  (At least it's better than the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 box I had to start with.)  Weirdly enough, it wouldn't connect to my Google Talk account, although my Debian Unstable box at home has no problem with Pidgin (GAIM's sucessor).  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I tried multiple solutions.  I fooled around with every setting.  Being the Alpha Geek, I tried downloading the Ubuntu source packages, but the support tools aren't available in Dapper.  I tried comparing the configuration with my home box, thanks to SSH.  I even tried logging in manually.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
What finally fixed the problem?  Google Talk can use port 80.  Yup, work must be filtering port 5222, and I couldn't even tell from my telnet sessions.  Some alpha geek I am.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The kicker, of course, is that I can't connect to his AIM user from my Google Talk account.  I had to register an AIM user to connect to him, rendering the whole thing moot.  Well, mostly moot: I can now IM with my wife, anyway.  &#13;
