<p>
I've been busy with work, iPhone development, and my car, so I haven't been posting here much.  The rest of my family has been busy with their spring break.  
</p><p>
Last weekend, Melissa an I took a walk in the woods.  We discovered a river running through our development that we never even suspected.  Here are some pictures of what we found, especially the weird tree stalagmites.  (Apologies for the blurriness of some pictures; they were taken by a 10-year-old with a cell phone.  :-D)
