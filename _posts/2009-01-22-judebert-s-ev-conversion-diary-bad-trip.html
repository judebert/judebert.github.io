<p>Today I took Tatiana to school, then turned around and went to work.
</p><p>
I didn't check the distance.
</p><p>
By the time I made it to UCF, I was more than half done.  Voltage was dropping to 105V during acceleration.  I never let it get below 110V.  I switched to a lower gear, figuring that slower acceleration and creeping along would get me to work, and turned on the emergency lights.
</p><p>
Less than a mile later, it was dropping to 96V under anemic acceleration.  I was passing my kids' old preschool, but I figured I could just switch to first and make it to work.
</p><p>
My voltage fell off a cliff.  Less than half a mile down the road, it was at 88V just maintaining 25MPH.  I pulled into the police station.  Resting voltage was only 116V.  
</p><p>
I asked if I could plug in, pointing to the soda machine's outlet.  The lady behind the window said, "Sure."  I had to turn around and back into the space, because my cord was too short.
</p><p>
20 minutes later, I finished my trip to work.  I was dropping to 108V on acceleration, but resting voltage was 120V.  I plugged in, cranked the current up to 14A, and left it all day.
</p><p>
There doesn't <em>seem</em> to be any permanent damage.  We'll see in the next few days.
</p><p>
Update 2009-01-22: it's 6 miles round trip to Tatiana's school.  That means I made it about 11 miles, killing the batteries for the last mile or so.  So, in 40F weather, my effective range is about 10 miles.
