On Tuesday, Greg Frenette, manager of Ford's Global Electrified Fleets, <a href="http://www.centralfloridafuture.com/ford-showcases-green-electric-cars-at-ucf-1.2176654"> came to UCF with a prototype Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid Electic Vehicle (PHEV)</a> to show off their <a href="http://www.centralfloridafuture.com/solar-charging-station-planned-for-student-use-1.2162596">new solar EV charging station</a>.  I had received an invitation via Facebook, and I planned to show up early and charge my home-built EV in the new spaces.  I figured I'd be available if there was a problem, and Silent E would likely get a picture with Ford's prototype.  I had even washed and waxed her for the event.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, one of my children got sick, and I had to take her to the doctor.  I didn't have time to attend the photo-op, but I did go to the lecture.
</p><p>
And thus began the adventure.
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>
To allow me to attend the lecture as long as possible, Eri was going to bring Kayla to the school, where I could pick her up and proceed to the doctor's office.  To make it that far, I would plug in and charge during the lecture.
</p><p>
I arrived at the charging station at 8:45 or so.  All four spaces were roped off.  Luckily there was a guy there; when I asked if I could pretty-please charge my EV, he actually called his supervisor to find out.  I was told the spaces were "not activated yet", and directed to a different parking lot.  
</p><p>
They had some spaces roped off for the lecture, but no electrical plugs.  They even walked around and looked.  My plans had to change; I'd be leaving the lecture early to go home and use a gas car to take Kayla to the doctor.
</p><p>
I was wearing my <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/Judebert">"Electric Love" T-shirt</a> (the blue one) with the same heart design that's on my rear windshield.  I was the only one with a T-shirt in the whole room.  I felt out-of-place, but nobody stopped me as I headed to the buffet for a scone and danish.
</p><p>
I made conversation with the folks seated nearby.  It turned out that my neighbor was Angelo, from <a href="http://rubelab.org">RubeLab</a>!  I had just accepted their invitation to the <a href="http://rubelab.org/green/green.html">RubeLab Green Fair and Rube Rally</a>, a 15-mile alternative energy scavenger hunt.  We chatted while we waited for the presentation.
</p><p>
Mr. Frenette claimed that Ford was dedicated to alternative energy, and gave us a plan to back it up.  He talked about Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technologies (the prototype Escape uses wireless networking to talk with a smart meter); he explained that battery cost is the big problem, and that it can be alleviated if we take advantage of economies of scale <b>and</b> find a "secondary use" (a way to sell the used batteries) like stationary power systems (battery banks for home solar installation); he even addressed the problem with extra drain on the grid, showing us that the grid would need to handle between 17% and 25% more current than it dows now.
</p><p>
But the most interesting stuff, to me, was Ford's new BEVs.  They're releasing the "Transit Connect", a "small van", later this year.  It's actually a commercial van, good for florists and carpenters and such, with an 80-mile range.  It looks to me like it could easily be a 7-passenger vehicle.  
</p><p>
In 2012, they expect to release a new BEV.  They're prototyping it on the Focus platform, but according to Mr. Frenette, it will look entirely different: "sexy" and "futuristic".  
</p><p>
Between that and the Nissan Leaf, I may have to trade in Silent E.  I once promised to buy the first commercial car that would carry my whole family 40 miles on electricity alone.  I'm lucky I left "family" vague, since it's expanded to include Omi, for a total of 6 persons; otherwise, I'd have to buy the Leaf right away to keep my honor.
</p><p>
I have to modify the 40 miles a little, too.  I really need to take my kids to school and back, twice.  So here's the big promise: I will purchase the first commercially manufactured vehicle that will take my entire family to the farthest child's school and back twice.
</p><p>
I left before I could participate in the question-and-answer session.  Eri was already bringing Kayla, so she had to turn around and meet me at home.  I took a gas car to the doctor, and then drove my EV to work, arriving quite late.
</p><p>
So much for my attempt at party-crashing.
