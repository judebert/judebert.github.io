I haven't added my app to the Facebook directory or even told anyone about it yet; nevertheless, I somehow wound up with more than 1000 users in my database!  (And oddly, Facebook only mentioned 299 "monthly active users"; I wonder how they got that number?)  
</p><p>
The app is nowhere near ready, and I don't anyone seeing my plans, since stealing Facebook app ideas is rampant (just look at anything by Zynga)!  So I shut it down.
</p><p>
But I still need to develop.  And I'd like to let my friends visit, since they'll give me good feedback without causing me trouble.  What to do?
</p><p>
Program them in, of course.  Read on for my three-step approach.
</p><a id="extended"></a><p> 
Preconditions: shut down the app to everybody.  Visit and make sure that nobody can get in.  After <a href="/progress/archives/367-Facebook-Development-PHP-FBML-Skeleton.html">the bit that verifies I've got a valid user ID</a>, just add this snippet:
</p>
{% highlight php %}
echo "<error message="Too soon!">This app is not ready for release yet.  Please come back later.</error>\n";
return;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Okay, now we're ready to start letting people in, selectively.
</p><p>
First step: don't let anybody in but me.  Since my user ID is 1077135837, that's as easy as can be.   I just checked to see if the valid user id was mine:
</p>
{% highlight php %}
if ($user_id != 1077135837) {
  echo "<error message="Too soon!">This app is not ready for release yet.  Please come back later.</error>\n";
  echo "<p>Thanks for visiting, <name uid="$user_id" linked="false" useyou="false"></name>.</p>";
  return;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The "Thanks for visiting" message is my not-too-subtle debugging attempt; if I can't get in, I'd like to know what user ID it <i>thinks</i> I'm using.  
</p><p>
Okay, step 2: allow my friends in.  Luckily, Facebook passes a POST variable with all the visitor's friends' user IDs.  (Say that three times fast!)  I just search in there to see if mine is listed, using PHP's handy-dandy in_array() and explode() functions.  Since I'm using my user ID twice, I turn it into a variable, $me.
</p>
{% highlight php %}
$me = 1077135837;
if ($user_id != $me) {
  $friends = explode(',', $_POST['fb_sig_friends']);
  if (!in_array($me, $friends)) {
    echo "<error message="Too soon!">This app is not ready for release yet.  Please come back later.</error>\n";
    echo "<p>Thanks for visiting, <name uid="$user_id" linked="false" useyou="false"></name>.</p>";
    return;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
So now my friends can all get in, too.  This is exactly what I want.
</p><p>
Step 3: allow friends of my friends to get in.  This may seem counter-intuitive, but consider it an invitation-only release process.  It'll prevent my app from getting too big too quickly, allow me a chance to correct errors with a group of reasonably forgiving people, and judge whether I need to buy a standalone server.  
</p><p>
The idea here is to check the database for each user in the visitor's friends' list.  Some people have really big friend lists, though; rather than running a query for each friend, I'd rather just run a single query returning all the friends.  Heck, even just a count of friends who are in the database would be enough for this!  Since databases vary, I can only provide some sample SQL here.  You'll have to modify it for your needs:
</p>
{% highlight php %}
$safe_friends = mysql_real_escape_string($friends);
$sql = "SELECT COUNT(u.id) FROM users AS u WHERE u.id IN ($safe_friends)";
$rows = mysql_query($sql, $dblink);
$result = mysql_fetch_row($rows);
if ($result === false || $result[0] &lt;= 0) {
  // You're not allowed... yet.
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
So, there you go!  Effective, simple user filtering for your unreleased Facebook app.
