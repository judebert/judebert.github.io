<p>&#13;
I haven't added my app to the Facebook directory or even told anyone about it yet; nevertheless, I somehow wound up with more than 1000 users in my database!  (And oddly, Facebook only mentioned 299 "monthly active users"; I wonder how they got that number?)  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The app is nowhere near ready, and I don't anyone seeing my plans, since stealing Facebook app ideas is rampant (just look at anything by Zynga)!  So I shut it down.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But I still need to develop.  And I'd like to let my friends visit, since they'll give me good feedback without causing me trouble.  What to do?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Program them in, of course.  Read on for my three-step approach.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p> &#13;
Preconditions: shut down the app to everybody.  Visit and make sure that nobody can get in.  After <a href="/progress/archives/367-Facebook-Development-PHP-FBML-Skeleton.html%5D">the bit that verifies I've got a valid user ID</a>, just add this snippet:&#13;
</p>&#13;
[code]&#13;
echo "<error message="Too soon!">This app is not ready for release yet.  Please come back later.</error>\n";&#13;
return;&#13;
[/code]&#13;
<p>&#13;
Okay, now we're ready to start letting people in, selectively.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
First step: don't let anybody in but me.  Since my user ID is 1077135837, that's as easy as can be.   I just checked to see if the valid user id was mine:&#13;
</p>&#13;
[code]&#13;
if ($user_id != 1077135837) {&#13;
  echo "<error message="Too soon!">This app is not ready for release yet.  Please come back later.</error>\n";&#13;
  echo "<p>Thanks for visiting, <name uid="$user_id" linked="false" useyou="false"></name>.</p>";&#13;
  return;&#13;
}&#13;
[/code]&#13;
<p>&#13;
The "Thanks for visiting" message is my not-too-subtle debugging attempt; if I can't get in, I'd like to know what user ID it <i>thinks</i> I'm using.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Okay, step 2: allow my friends in.  Luckily, Facebook passes a POST variable with all the visitor's friends' user IDs.  (Say that three times fast!)  I just search in there to see if mine is listed, using PHP's handy-dandy in_array() and explode() functions.  Since I'm using my user ID twice, I turn it into a variable, $me.&#13;
</p>&#13;
[code]&#13;
$me = 1077135837;&#13;
if ($user_id != $me) {&#13;
  $friends = explode(',', $_POST['fb_sig_friends']);&#13;
  if (!in_array($me, $friends)) {&#13;
    echo "<error message="Too soon!">This app is not ready for release yet.  Please come back later.</error>\n";&#13;
    echo "<p>Thanks for visiting, <name uid="$user_id" linked="false" useyou="false"></name>.</p>";&#13;
    return;&#13;
  }&#13;
}&#13;
[/code]&#13;
<p>&#13;
So now my friends can all get in, too.  This is exactly what I want.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Step 3: allow friends of my friends to get in.  This may seem counter-intuitive, but consider it an invitation-only release process.  It'll prevent my app from getting too big too quickly, allow me a chance to correct errors with a group of reasonably forgiving people, and judge whether I need to buy a standalone server.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The idea here is to check the database for each user in the visitor's friends' list.  Some people have really big friend lists, though; rather than running a query for each friend, I'd rather just run a single query returning all the friends.  Heck, even just a count of friends who are in the database would be enough for this!  Since databases vary, I can only provide some sample SQL here.  You'll have to modify it for your needs:&#13;
</p>&#13;
[code]&#13;
$safe_friends = mysql_real_escape_string($friends);&#13;
$sql = "SELECT COUNT(u.id) FROM users AS u WHERE u.id IN ($safe_friends)";&#13;
$rows = mysql_query($sql, $dblink);&#13;
$result = mysql_fetch_row($rows);&#13;
if ($result === false || $result[0] &lt;= 0) {&#13;
  // You're not allowed... yet.&#13;
}&#13;
[/code]&#13;
<p>&#13;
So, there you go!  Effective, simple user filtering for your unreleased Facebook app.&#13;
</p>
