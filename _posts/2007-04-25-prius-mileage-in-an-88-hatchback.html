<p>So you remember, perhaps, <a href="/progress/permalink/Good-Car-ma.html">I recently got a used Honda Civic Hatchback</a> from a friend.  Lucky, too, since my own car had just broken down.  Imagine my surprise when, on my first tank of gas, I made 31 MPG.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Well, that piqued my curiosity.  Could I do better?  You bet: I just got 42 MPG with no modifications!  How?  I'll tell you.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>I started by inflating the tires.  These tires are mismatched, since one of them suffered a bubble right next to the rim.  THat means I can't inflate them to their max value.  I settled for something suboptimal for everything.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
That brought me up to 37 MPG.  Yes, just that.  And my driving is mostly city, with two 5-mile highway runs each week.  An average of 26 miles per day, round trip.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Then I learned about "pulse and glide".  Since I've got a manual transmission, it's easy for me.  I just accelerate gradually to my top speed, kill the engine, coast to my bottom speed, and start the engine again.  The acceleration is pulsing, the rest is gliding.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I stayed in the right lane, to avoid annoying people.  I didn't get upset at folks who decided to go around me -- if they want to burn their money, that's their perogative.  I started looking farther ahead, gauging lights and waiting times, and using my brakes as little as possible.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I just got 42.15 MPG on my latest fill-up.  More than 400 miles on that 10 gallon tank.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I feel like my father, since he's been doing all this stuff since the last gas crisis.  But I'm saving money, polluting less, and running with the hybrids.  I'll bet I can get even better with a tune-up and new tires.  Then there's the aerodynamic, timing, and suspension modifications I could make...&#13;
