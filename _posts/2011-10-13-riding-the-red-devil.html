  content: After riding the scooter for 8 trips, it's quit on me. It's been going
    so well, too! It started so easily, and worked so well. Now it stalls whenever
    I try to accelerate. I can even sit on it, hold it back with my feet on the ground,
    and stall it by a

I've been riding <a href="/progress/scooter/The-Red-Devil.html">The Red Devil</a> to work for almost two weeks now.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
While I hear lots of talk about scooters and motorcycles being invisible to normal drivers, I've had very little trouble.  Almost everybody notices me and gives me safe space.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Oddly, all the problems I've had have been with giant trucks and SUVs. In the scariest incident, I was going 30 in a 25mph zone; the giant black SUV behind me wanted to go 40, and decided he could share the lane with me while he roared up to the red light.  Doofus.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
Regardless, most people are nice.  On the other hand, The Red Devil is scary.  It's only a 50cc scooter; I don't think it's designed for a 300-pound guy to drive it at 35mph.  Every time I hit a bump, it feels like the scooter has gone airborne.  Even the seat is under-designed: I get theater butt during the 30-minute ride to work.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Going around a corner is scary.  Even a curve in the road is frightening, since you have to tilt the whole scooter a bit.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
And when I get to my destination, my hands and feet are vibrating like mad.  It's just like when you push around your lawnmower for a while.  Which makes sense, since they're both probably two-cycle engines.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I've also discovered a list of things that need to be fixed.  I've already noted that my fixes so far have required a bit of ingenuity; we'll see how these repairs fare:&#13;
</p><ul>&#13;
<li>Oil light doesn't come on</li>&#13;
<li>Right front blinker intermittent</li>&#13;
<li>Left front blinker and hand brake loose (plastic mount broken)</li>&#13;
<li>Speedometer intermittent (may be related to scratchy spinny sound)</li>&#13;
<li>No way to inflate wheels (rear may be low)</li>&#13;
<li>Whole thing covered in greasy grime</li>&#13;
</ul><p>&#13;
On the plus side, riding a scooter is a load of fun.  Especially after you get accustomed to banking.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Last Friday, when I came home, the kids were flying kites in the front yard.  Or trying to.  We wedged one of the spools into my "luggage rack", and I pulled the kite around the cul-de-sac.  Everybody loved it!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Now <b>that</b>, my friends, is good family fun!&#13;
