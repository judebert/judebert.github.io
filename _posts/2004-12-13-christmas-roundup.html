<strong>Christmas Roundup is presentable!</strong> I've been working on <a href="/progress/Roundup.html">a little Christmas game</a> for a while. Every Christmas it gets a couple of weeks of my time. It's nowhere near finished, and the sound is really bad, but I think it's ready enough to let you play around with it. <em>Requires Java 1.4 or better.</em>
