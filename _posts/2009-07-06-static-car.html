  content: Producing electric cars have no economical potential right now. I hope
    that soon they (the constructors, developers, scientists?) will project a battery
    able to sustain enough energy to ride for the whole day and easy to recharge.
    It is our problem that we don't know - we can't store energy we produce. And have
    to waste so much, because if we produce less energy than needed, we would have
    major blackouts all over the country. Because there are no blackouts (except California,
    in the hottest days) we produce more energy than we need. If we just could store
    it in some kind of batteries we could save trillions of trillions of dollars by
    now.

  content: "I'm not so sure about the \"no economical potential\" bit.  Many of the
    people who converted their own EVs say they'd have been happy to buy one, if it
    had been available.\r\n\r\nBattery technology has always been the big problem.
    \ Lithium batteries are big enough to supply most driving needs, and hybrids with
    generators can pick up the slack there.  But the batteries aren't the barrier
    to recharging: the wires are.\r\n\r\nMost batteries will happily recharge in less
    time than it takes to refuel your car.  My AGMs actually *like* a strong charge.
    \ But the amount of energy involved is so phenomenal, it would require a 3-foot-thick
    wire to transfer it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, power companies regulate their turbines
    to burn less coal/oil/gas so they produce only the electricity necessary to meet
    the instantaneous demand.  It's only when the demand exceeds the capacity that
    we get blackouts.  However, it's true that solar, wind, and other alternative
    energy sources would benefit from better battery technology."

<p>Wading through my webcomics backlog, I came upon <a href="http://www.kevinandkell.com/2009/kk0511.html">this delightful electric car strip from Kevin &amp; Kell.</a>&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Of course, I can personally verify that electric cars don't go "vroom".  They go "whoosh", "whizz", and "whirr", but not "vroom". :)&#13;
