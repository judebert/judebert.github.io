    \ The open circuit voltage of your traction pack seems to be high at 132 volts.
    \ Is this immediately following charging?  The nominal open circuit voltage calculates
    to 126 (2.1*6*10).\r\n\r\nThe 110v estimate at 80%, however, does look fairly
    close by interpolating the C3 discharge rate to a C1 rate in the pdf document
    above."

    should have been only 40% discharged!"

  content: "Handy spreadsheet!  After looking in Wikipedia on lead acid batteries,
    there is a simple explanation of where the difference in voltage is coming from
    (12.6v versus 13.2v).  Both values are actually correct when put into proper context.\r\n\r\nAfter
    full charge the terminal voltage will drop quickly to 13.2 V and then slowly to
    12.6 V.\r\nOpen-circuit (quiescent) at full charge: 12.6 V to 12.8 V (2.10-2.13V
    per cell)\r\n\r\nOf course we know which value the marketing folks are going to
    choose! :)"

<p>
This morning I used Silent E for a scenario outside its design plan: I dropped Tatiana off on my way to work.  It's about 5 miles out of my way.
</p><p>
Knowing that my battery capacity was limited, I drove quite carefully.  I drove a route that (I hoped) would reduce the overall distance; I braked carefully and utilized coasting as much as possible; I accelerated so that my voltage never dropped below 110V on my 120V pack.  I even started with an overcharged pack.
</p><p>
When I got to work, I had driven 11.7 miles, and my resting voltage was 122V.  
</p><p>
Is that good?
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>
Heck if I know.  This is just a WAG, but let's assume voltage declines linearly with battery capacity: if you've got 50% of your voltage, you've got 50% of the energy in your battery pack left.
</p><p>
I know that DEAD is 10.5V, and FULL is 13.2V (although on these damaged batteries, full appears to be 130V; we'll ignore that for our calculations).  If all 10 batteries were the same, the pack would be dead at 105V and full at 132V.  Since I'm at 122V, I must not be dead.
</p><p>
But we never want to get below 80% of the battery capacity (or 20% full).  The voltage range is 132 - 105 = 27V.  20% of 27V is 5.4V.  So I would never want to be below 105 + 5.4 = 110.4V.  
</p><p>
<b>But that's only if resting voltage is a good linear indicator of battery capacity.</b>  Somehow I doubt it is.  On the EV list, they say the best way to measure battery capacity from voltage is to check the <b>voltage under load</b>.  That's why I keep my E-meter on its voltage display: I don't want voltage to drop under 110V even while I accelerate, and I can watch the voltage under load.
</p><p>
10 miles into the trip, my E-meter thought I was down to 20% of the pack.  Around that time, I was actually using 1st gear.  And even mild acceleration was dipping below 105V, if only for fractions of a second.
</p><p>
I hope someone can tell me how to interpret this data.  I intend to ask the EVDL later tonight.
