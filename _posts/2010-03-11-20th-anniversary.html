That's right, twentieth!  
</p><p>
An overgenerous donation from a friend who appreciated my Serendipity work made a cozy celebration possible.  We went to Houston's for dinner, where Eri had the best prime rib we've ever tasted.  (Prime rib is traditional for our wedding celebrations.)
</p><p>
The evening was enchanted.  Every light turned green as we approached it.  We found parking spaces in crowded lots.  We found a "Modern Bridal Shop Elite Fighting Academy" sign (thankfully, they weren't training brides that way 20 years ago.)
</p><p>
Rather than something mundane like a movie, we went to S.A.K. Comedy Lab.  I've always enjoyed improv, and these guys did a really good job, while keeping it PG-13.  Along the way, we got to see some interesting advertising games going on outside, and the gallery downstairs.
</p><p>
Finally, we went to the Cheesecake Factory for a Mississippi Mud Pie (also a wedding celebration tradition).  While their peanut butter cheesecake was delicious, their mud pie was direly deficient.  It's supposed to be coffee and chocolate ice cream, with a layer of fudge on top, with an oreo cracker crust.  Theirs was a chocolate cake, topped with a scoop of coffee and a scoop of vanilla, with whipped cream, a cherry, and fudge on the side.  Anybody know where you can get a good mud pie in Orlando?

We didn't want to go to bed, but all good things must end eventually.  We had a great time, and it's a night we won't soon forget.
