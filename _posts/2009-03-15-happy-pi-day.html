<p>For Pi Day, we made t-shirts.  It's the first 10,000 digits of Pi (including the integer part and the decimal point) arranged in a 100x100 square.  The greek letter Pi is imposed as a rainbow over some of the digits.&#13;

Tatiana got the first one so she could wear it when she went to her math competition.  She was the fashion goddess of her team (and took 7th place individual, 2nd place team).  &#13;

The rest of the family wore their shirts to the award ceremony.  If we get the chance, we'll take a picture of them someday.  For now, our camera isn't working.  But our Pi are square!&#13;
