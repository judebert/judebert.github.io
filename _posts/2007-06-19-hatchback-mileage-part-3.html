</a><p>I filled up on Wednesday.  557.9 miles on this tank, still pulsing and gliding.  Worse yet, there's been a bunch of rain (which robs your momentum), two panic runs, and a dead battery.

10.298 gallons.  That's <b>54.2 MPG!</b>  Better than <a href="/progress/permalink/hypermiling02.html">last time</a>, although I have NO idea how that happened.  I've inspired coworkers to make their own attempts at fuel efficiency.  Now I really need that bumper sticker.
