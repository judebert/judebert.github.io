Since Omi's moved into a retirement community, we're cleaning out her apartment, getting it ready for sale.  Today Nathan came to help us move stuff.  We rented a big U-Haul; it didn't fit, and the homeowner's association would allow us to keep it on the property anyway.
</p><p>
We tried to move two 7-foot solid oak bookshelves, but they wouldn't fit in the elevator.  No way were lugging them down 7 flights of stairs, either.  Nathan got to take anything he wanted from Opi's tool closet.  But the big acquisition of the day had to be the HDTV.
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>
This is the first TV I've owned that I couldn't pick up on my own.  It's a monstrous CRT model, not a flat-panel LCD or something.  It will replace the 26.5" model that Eri and I picked out together; that one has served our needs for 15 years or so, but the sound is going bad.  We're happy to have a replacement.
</p><p>
We managed to fit the new TV in the van, but we had to put its entertainment center on top.  Nathan showed me a knot he uses; he calls it a "trucker's half hitch", because a <b>real</b> trucker's hitch has a slip knot to untie quickly, but his improvised knot will actually melt itself together from the pressure.
</p><p>
We also brought some stuff for Omi, and filled up the car with other salvage.  Then we returned the empty U-Haul, unloaded everything at home, and went to the monthly family celebration, which included my birthday.

And my Dad's birthday.  Unfortunately, things have been so busy I hadn't gotten him a present.  I will rectify this as quickly as I can.
