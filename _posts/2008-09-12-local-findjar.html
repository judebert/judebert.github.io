<a href="http://findjar.com/">FindJar</a> is an online search engine that tries to tell Java programmers which jar file holds the class they need.  It's always done a mediocre job for me.
</p><p>
<a href="http://wiki.osuosl.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2483"><strong>The FindJar Python script does a fantastic job;</strong> it searches your local directories.</a>   That way you don't have to worry about results from libraries you've never heard of, or from jars so outdated they blight the rest of your code.
</p><p>
I'd probably like regular expression parsing, and maybe a printout of all the classes in all the jar files.  After all, I've got a few thousand, and it can take a while to search.  But hey -- it's Free, I can see the source.

Time to learn Python!
