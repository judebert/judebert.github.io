<p>Want to create your own government?  You couldn't have better examples than the founding fathers of the USA.  I found <a href="http://www.constitution.org/afp/afpchron.htm">this wonderful reference to the Anti-Federalist and Federalist Papers in chronological context</a> that shows how they went about it.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Light reading it ain't, but it's not too hard to digest in small chunks.  The gold nugget that leads me to write this blog post is the <a href="http://www.constitution.org/dfc/dfc_0529.htm">opening of the main debate of the Constitutional Convention</a>, which lays out the reasons we need government and what it ought to do.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We had a confederation for eight years before we became a republic.  Not everyone agreed that a change was necessary.  There was a lot of debate.  This site lays it all out for your edification.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
<b>That's</b> great politics.  &#13;
