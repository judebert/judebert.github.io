<p>Since I've only been driving Silent E for a week, I've kept Ao-kun (my Civic Hatchback) as a safety net just in case I have problems.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I knew yesterday's trip to Goodwill would probably be out of Silent E's range, so on Monday I drove her batteries down to 118V, then set her up with a very slow charge (1A) to try and get the batteries equalized.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Ao-kun did fine on the way to work.  There was an emergency afterwards, though, and I had to take kids home.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Things got worse from there.  I got a flat, couldn't inflate it with Fix-a-Flat, couldn't inflate it from the gas station pump, destroyed the valve, overheated the engine, and generally pushed the car beyond any reasonable limits to pick up my kids and get them home.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Ao-kun needs two new tires before he moves again.  Until then, Silent E is running without a net as my <b>only</b> daily driver.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'm only a little worried.  I think I'll just sell Ao-kun as is, let somebody else handle the tires, and put all that expense into tools and upgrades for Silent E.&#13;
</p>
