<p>&#13;
We recently clogged our kitchen sink.  We just put too much stuff down the disposal, I think.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I bought a snake, disassembled the drain, and went to work.  It was <em><strong>DISGUSTING</strong></em>!  About 10 feet in, I found a clog, and managed to do a little something... but not enough.  It wouldn't drain.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I tried using the CLR compressed-air kit.  It blew a bunch of water out the roof air vent.  Very impressive, but not helpful.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I used an entire bottle of Draino gel.   It sat overnight, but the water didn't move.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We called a plumber recommended by a friend: Ace Plumbing in Kissimmee.  They were <strong><em>HORRIBLE</em></strong>.  They charged $80 to come give us an estimate -- that should have been our first clue that something was wrong, since the guy just opened up his notebook and quoted a <em>fixed price</em> directly from it.  Oh, and it costs $750 for Ace Plumbing to snake your kitchen drain!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We later found out Lowe's will do it for $150.  But it's hard to make this kind of comparison when you've already paid $80 just for the guy to show up, and then he's standing there waiting for you to make a decision.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
He also broke the seal on the kitchen sink drain, then claimed that I had caused the damage when I added the Draino.  He further claimed that the seal couldn't be purchased separately, and quoted $150 to replace the drain.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We found the seal later for $15 at Ace Hardware in Oviedo -- a fine institution, which has been helpful to me many times in the past.  Despite the name similarity, they have no relation to the nefarious organization that I mistakenly hired.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'm considering whether there's some way I can retrieve the lost $600.  Could I claim fraud in small claims court?  Probably not: I hired him and signed the receipt without comparison shopping.  <em>Sigh.</em>&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I still feel like I've been ripped off.  I'm never using them again.&#13;
