<p>In short, it doesn't work.
</p><p>
I drove through a giant puddle caused by ex-hurricane Fay.  Eri has been really worried about that; she seems to think it'll destroy my car or something.  (In reality, the water isn't conductive enough to cause a problem in the motor.  In fact, it would help cool it.  The dirt in the water is problematic, but not a huge deal.)  My engine compartment is organized so that nothing important got wet.
</p><p>
But it got in my spare tire well, which is where my charger resides.  It apparently got wet, because turning it on tripped my GFCI.  
</p><p>
I let it dry out for a day or so.  I planned to use a hair dryer on its fan ports if it wasn't dry, but yesterday morning I started charging as usual.  Today I'm all full.
