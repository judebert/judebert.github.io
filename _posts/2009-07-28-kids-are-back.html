<p>&#13;
My two eldest kids just spent a weekend with their aunt in Miami.  She's much cooler than we are, of course.  They had a great time, and even brought us back some souvenirs.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Naturally we had to make sure the youngest had a good time, too.  We went to DisneyQuest.  (When the eldest kids found out, they were royally pissed.  Melissa actually sat on the bed and not-talked to Eri... until she fell asleep.)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Unfortunately, Kayla didn't enjoy DisneyQuest as much as we had hoped.  She would rather have gone swimming.  In fairness, she did have a lot of fun.  She just didn't think it lived up to its hype.  She wasn't all that impressed with the VR games, she didn't like pinball, and she couldn't go on the Buzz Lightyear ride.  She was much happier when we went walking in the rain, and when she got to play at the Lego store.  Of course, she hated getting pulled out of the Lego store when I pulled up with the ride home.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
On the other hand, I loved it!  Lots of classic games, mostly in good working order.  Plenty of modern games, also in good condition.  Skee-ball, air hockey, pinball machines... I was very happy.  I hated the virtual reality games: they made me sick.  But I actually got a partner to play Karate Champ with!  And they had a Tux Racer arcade machine!&#13;

We tried to make it up to Kayla with a steak dinner.  Yesterday evening, she told me she had a great time at DisneyQuest.  I guess time heals all wounds.&#13;

It's nice to have the bigger kids back, though.  The house was kinda lonely without 'em.&#13;
