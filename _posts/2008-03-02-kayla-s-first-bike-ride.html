Today we taught Kayla to ride without training wheels.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We're probably a little late doing this.  She wore the rubber off the training wheels already.  &#13;

<p>&#13;
On the way to the cul-de-sac, we did some practicing.  I held on to the bottom of the bike seat to keep her from falling over.  I think she had problems because the road is slightly crowned.  She kept listing to the left.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I got a little winded.  I need to improve my cardio workout.&#13;

<p>&#13;
For her first few attempts, we just biked across the cul-de-sac.  I helped, but I didn't have to interfere much. &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Running half-crouched really exercises your glutes.&#13;

Eri didn't want me to have all the fun.  She took over after a few runs.&#13;

<p>&#13;
This near miss turned out to be prophetic.  Mommy stopped Kayla before she came close to the tilted mailbox.&#13;
</p>&#13;

Kayla was unphased by the near-miss.  Erica starting holding on to her shirt instead of the bike; next thing we knew, she was biking on her own!&#13;
</p>&#13;
<br style="clear:both;" />&#13;

We did several back-and-forth runs.  She needed a push to get started, but that was it.  In fact, she kept saying, "Daddy, let go now!"&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
She eventually scraped past a big stone mailbox, but that didn't even phase her.  She wasn't exactly the most stable rider in the world, but she was biking on her own!&#13;
</p>&#13;

</figure>&#13;
<p>&#13;
Eventually she crashed.  She was looking at her feet and didn't see the mailbox coming.  When she looked up, she was so shocked she forgot how to stop.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The result was a small scrape on her thigh, a bruise on her bum, and a hug from Daddy.  She didn't want to stop, but she did want a little closer supervision.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We tried to get her to bike in circles, but she just didn't have the control.  Big sis Melissa tried to lead her around, but Kayla just needed more practice.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
After a while we decided to head for home.  Kayla biked all the way there, with a little help from her parents.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
A highly successful day.  Kayla is riding two wheels!&#13;
