Today we taught Kayla to ride without training wheels.
</p><p>
We're probably a little late doing this.  She wore the rubber off the training wheels already.

On the way to the cul-de-sac, we did some practicing.  I held on to the bottom of the bike seat to keep her from falling over.  I think she had problems because the road is slightly crowned.  She kept listing to the left.
</p><p>
I got a little winded.  I need to improve my cardio workout.

For her first few attempts, we just biked across the cul-de-sac.  I helped, but I didn't have to interfere much. 
</p><p>
Running half-crouched really exercises your glutes.

Eri didn't want me to have all the fun.  She took over after a few runs.

This near miss turned out to be prophetic.  Mommy stopped Kayla before she came close to the tilted mailbox.

Kayla was unphased by the near-miss.  Erica starting holding on to her shirt instead of the bike; next thing we knew, she was biking on her own!

<p>
We did several back-and-forth runs.  She needed a push to get started, but that was it.  In fact, she kept saying, "Daddy, let go now!"
</p><p>
She eventually scraped past a big stone mailbox, but that didn't even phase her.  She wasn't exactly the most stable rider in the world, but she was biking on her own!

<p>
Eventually she crashed.  She was looking at her feet and didn't see the mailbox coming.  When she looked up, she was so shocked she forgot how to stop.  
</p><p>
The result was a small scrape on her thigh, a bruise on her bum, and a hug from Daddy.  She didn't want to stop, but she did want a little closer supervision.
</p><p>
We tried to get her to bike in circles, but she just didn't have the control.  Big sis Melissa tried to lead her around, but Kayla just needed more practice.
</p><p>
After a while we decided to head for home.  Kayla biked all the way there, with a little help from her parents.
</p><p>
A highly successful day.  Kayla is riding two wheels!
