<p>For the first time, I ascended in the <a href="http://nethack.devnull.net/">Annual Nethack Tournament</a>!  <a href="http://nethack.org">Nethack</a> is one of my favorite games ever; I like playing Rogues and Wizards.  My only previous attempt at the Tourney, I played a Wizard.  My score was astronomical, but I just didn't have time to finish playing.
</p><p>
This year, I played a Valkyrie, because they're supposed to be easy.  I made a few stupid mistakes, and I didn't have enough time to play, but at the end of the month I rushed through her ascension.  My score was #16 overall at the time.
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>
I also completed the Grue Challenge, which I'm inordinately proud about.  Here's some information for myself, for next year:
</p><p>
<strong>The Grue Challenge</strong> is triggered when you first step into darkness.  If you accept, you'll die when you're in darkness for more than 3 turns.  Get a magical light, go to the bottom of the Gnomish Mines, get the Frobozz(tm) Company Interdimensional Portal Generator, identity it, and use it.  Tah-dah!
</p><p>
<strong>The PacMan Challenge</strong> (added 2007) is triggered by a magical portal on the Oracle level.  Until you beat it, you're unable to eat any fruit of any sort.  It's a big PacMan maze, of course, with three ampersands (&amp;; demons, really, not ghosts) named Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde.  They're faster than you think.  You can only use the Power Pellets after you've identified them.  
</p><p>
You only get three lives to finish the PacMan maze.  If any of the demons touches you, you lose one life.  Additionally, the ghosts in the normal dungeon will take a life if they touch you, whether you've accepted the challenge yet or not.  I was already down to one life when I tried the challenge, and then I lost it straightaway, figuring that Pinky had to go straight -- he touched me diagonally.
</p><p>
In short, don't let ghosts touch you at all until you've finished the challenge.  Pump up your speed before you enter.  Remember to bring an identify scroll (or spell) with you.  Wokka.
</p><p>
<strong>The KoL Challenge</strong> refers to <a href="http://kingdomofloathing/">the Kingdom of Loathing</a>.  I've got myself an account over there, and I must admit it's pretty cool.  If you accept this challenge, you can't engrave "Elbereth" until you take out the Wizard of Yendor analogue in Kingdom of Lothing.   I never use Elbereth, so it's no biggie for me, but I'd like to complete the challenge.
</p><p>
I've been scavenging, and I *think* you need to pump your main stat to 45, then enter the Enormous Greater-Than Sign in the Dungeon Full of Dungeons.  Keep going until you get the Plus Sign, the effect Teleportitis (from a Q), and reach the Oracle.  After a major consultation (1000 meat), you can read the spellbook, whereupon the Enormous Greater-Than Sign turns into The Dungeons of Doom.
</p><p>
After that, I don't know.  Continue adventuring, see what happens?  
</p><p>
Can't wait till next year!
