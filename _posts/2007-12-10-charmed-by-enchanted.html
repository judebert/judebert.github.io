<p>So, we saw "<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0461770/">Enchanted</a>" this weekend.  (There was some family trouble, so we almost missed it.  The penalty: she had to pay for her own @*%! movie.)  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
While there were several fairy tale cliches, they were all <b>supposed</b> to be cliches; that's kinda the point.  It's Disney making fun of Disney, and they did a fairly good job, I must say.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I don't want to give anything away, so I'm not saying anything else.  If you like the same kind of movies I do, "Enchanted" is well worth your time.&#13;
