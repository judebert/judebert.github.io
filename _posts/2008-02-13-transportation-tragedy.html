So, that car I was hypermiling with started blowing oil smoke out its tailpipe (no comments from the peanut gallery, please).  I just couldn't stand it: I'm trying to help reduce pollution by driving carefully, and my car is leaving a giant blue cloud behind.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I took it to the shop.  They need a part that'll take most of a week to get.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The very next day, my wife crashed the minivan into a truck.  The minivan had some body damage, but no structural damage.  Some wires were cut, and it won't run.  The shop says $3500 and 3 weeks.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
That leaves us with exactly 0 working cars.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The rental is nice.  $39/day.  We're going to borrow a car from her parents.&#13;
