<p>
Tatiana went to another Mu Alpha Theta competition this weekend.  She took 9th place in the individual geometry competition!  <a href="/progress/archives/317-Math-Injury.html#extended">(Read on for one of the interesting problems she couldn't get.)</a>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, she suffered an injury.  You don't normally associate injuries with math; it's not a rough sport or anything.  But it turns out Tatiana inherited her mother's brittle feet.  She severely sprained her ankle on the way to the stage.
</p><p>
She's on crutches and ibuprofen.  
</p><p>
<strong>Update 2009-02-04:</strong> I will no longer take my family to the CentraCare on University Blvd.  After 48 hours without a reduction in swelling, we took her to our pediatrician, who discovered that the leg is actually fractured.  Tatiana is now in a walking cast for 4 weeks.<a id="extended"></a></p><p>
Problem number 15 was interesting.   Given a right triangle, such that the hypotenuse c = a + 1, what is b<sup>2</sup>?
</p><p>
It's not really difficult.  c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> so b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>.  Find c<sup>2</sup> with the classic FOIL method: (a + 1)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2a +1.  Subtract a<sup>2</sup>, and you see that c = 2a + 1.  
</p><p>
2a + 1 wasn't among the answers.
</p><p>
<em>But c + a was.</em>
</p><p>
You have to do an extra substitution step to realize that 2a + 1 is the same as a + c.  After all, 2a + 1 = a + (a + 1).  And earlier, we said that c = a + 1.  So 2a + 1 = a + c = c + a.
</p><p>
I suppose you could also have realized that a 3,4,5 triangle could be said to satisfy c = a + 1 (if you swap the common definitions for a and b).  Then b<sup>2</sup> is 9.  And 9 = 4 + 5.  
</p><p>
If you wanted to do it the easy, sissy way.
