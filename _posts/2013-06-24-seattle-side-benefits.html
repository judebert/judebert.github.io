I just moved in to the house at Maple Valley.  It's a 2-hour commute, including all the walking, but I've started carpooling with a guy who drives a Leaf (squee!).  Unfortunately, having no car means having no cargo capacity: if I want to get anything home, I have to carry it.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Including my laundry.  I tried to order a washer and dryer from Home Depot, but Wells Fargo screwed me up with a per-day credit charge limit.  (ARRGH!  It's <b>my money</b>, gorramit!)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Worse yet, on weekends, there are fewer buses.  So I walked a total of about 5 miles today, carrying a week's worth of laundry in a sports bag.  Dang, that thing is heavy.  My new blisters say so.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Luckily, Amazon Fresh delivers to my new house.  So I have a pleasant surprise waiting when I got home: two weeks worth of groceries!  It didn't seem any more expensive than going to the store myself, and I knew I got the best deal in the store because Amazon lets you order by unit price.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
What I didn't realize is that Amazon keeps the stuff cold on your doorstep by using <b>dry ice</b>.  Which I promptly loaded into my shower.  It makes a very pleasant bubbling sound.  And cool videos!&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
I covered the shower drain with a plastic bag (from one of the pieces of dry ice) and weighted it down with a cat food bowl.  Then I turned on the hot water and tossed in the dry ice.  This is the result!&#13;
