<p>I once signed up for a blog advertising service. They wouldn't take me because they supposedly found a gap of more than one week in my entries.  Ever since, I've tried to make at least one entry a week.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Now I've hit my Christmas and Hannukah rush.  I'm doing so many things: painting my car (entry coming soon!), working, trying to get Serendipity stuff done, shopping... and my friends have discovered Facebook.   I just don't have much time for blogging.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Besides, it was getting to be a burden.  Why should I blog when I don't have something interesting to say?  (Then again, I suppose that <em>something</em> interesting happens every day.  But I don't want to spout off about every little thing that happens.)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So I am officially throwing off the oppression of blogging!  I don't blog any more.  I update my <em>website</em> whenever I have something interesting to present.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Ha!  Take that, blog advertisers!  I may never make money off this website, but that's not why I created it, anyway.  I'm publishing to improve the world!  Anybody who wants my programs, tutorials, or experience in parenting and EV conversion  can benefit as long as I can afford to keep the website going.&#13;
