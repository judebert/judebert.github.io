I did a little work for a friend who <a href="http://thebrazeneye.myshopify.com/">sells art online</a>.  I've only recently learned that the language used is a variant of Ruby; I'm interested in learning more.
</p><p>
For some odd reason, she thought it necessary to compensate me.  She checked out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/36RVD5YZI2ID5">my wish list on Amazon</a> and remembered that my favorite actor is Danny Kaye.  So she did some legwork and bought me an out-of-print laserdisc: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039808/">The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</a>.  
</p><p>
I'm so excited!  The rear cover was a little munged up, but the disc looks just fine.  A different friend recommended it to me as her favorite Danny Kaye movie.

Copyright law allows one archival copy, so I've hooked the LD player to the Tivo.  With luck, the Tivo will allow me to record the movie, then burn it to a DVD.  
</p><p>
All I need now is two free hours to watch it!
