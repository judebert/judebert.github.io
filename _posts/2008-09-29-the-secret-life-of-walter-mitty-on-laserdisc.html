<p>&#13;
I did a little work for a friend who <a href="http://thebrazeneye.myshopify.com/">sells art online</a>.  I've only recently learned that the language used is a variant of Ruby; I'm interested in learning more.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
For some odd reason, she thought it necessary to compensate me.  She checked out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/36RVD5YZI2ID5">my wish list on Amazon</a> and remembered that my favorite actor is Danny Kaye.  So she did some legwork and bought me an out-of-print laserdisc: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039808/">The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</a>.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'm so excited!  The rear cover was a little munged up, but the disc looks just fine.  A different friend recommended it to me as her favorite Danny Kaye movie.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Copyright law allows one archival copy, so I've hooked the LD player to the Tivo.  With luck, the Tivo will allow me to record the movie, then burn it to a DVD.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
All I need now is two free hours to watch it!&#13;
