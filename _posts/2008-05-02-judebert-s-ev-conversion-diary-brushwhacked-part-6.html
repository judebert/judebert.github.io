    that needed atte"

Of course, Nathan's description of throwing sparks everywhere just made me want to try it myself.  Unfortunately, the reality was different.  And at Toolbane, catastrophic.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
I went to Ace yesterday and bought two cutting blades for the grinder.  One was 5/8, the other 7/8 (I think -- the point is, they were different sizes, okay?).  &#13;
</p><br style="clear: both;" />&#13;

  <figcaption>Ready for some sparks!</figcaption>
</figure>&#13;
<p>&#13;
I set everything up, clearing out plenty of space so nothing would get burned by molten sparks.  I attached the 5/8 x 4" wheel, measured to be sure it would cut through the aluminum, and started cutting.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
No sparks, but a whole lot of <b>loud</b>.  Next time I go to Ace, I'm buying ear protection.  There was also an awful smell, which I assume was burning metal, and lots of aluminum dust.  I tried hard not to breathe.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Before long, the wheel wasn't 4" long any more.  It couldn't actually cut through; I had to cut from the bottom.  That made a really ragged cut.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
And useless, too.  I needed a piece with a flat top, about 3 fingers wide (no side at this spot on the mount, so a guess was sufficient), and long enough to put two bolts through.  The piece I was looking at was definitely not it.&#13;
</p>&#13;

  <figcaption>Take two!  Don't bother thinking about it or anything, though.</figcaption>
</figure>&#13;
<p>&#13;
So I set everything up again.  This time I used my "square" to draw a couple of parallel lines to cut on.  Then I attached the larger wheel.  Neat setup, that.  The grinder supports both 5/8 and 7/8 wheels through a clever shaft configuration.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It was very hard keeping the grinder on the line.  After I scored it, I started cutting through from the edge, just to make sure it call all the way through.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Loud, loud, <b>LOUD!</b>&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Suddenly everything got a lot quieter and easier.  Then I noticed no cutting was actually being accomplished.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Toolbane is a magnificent garage; it won't allow anything to work as expected on its premises.  The cutting wheel had flown apart.  You can see the pieces in the first picture in this entry.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Tomorrow I have a date with my wife, so I'll be getting back to this on Saturday.  With ear protection.&#13;
