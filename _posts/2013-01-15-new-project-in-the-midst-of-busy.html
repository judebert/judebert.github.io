I've won the part of Wilbur in the (somewhat) nearby <a href="http://www.wdpac.com/">Wayne Densch Performing Arts</a> theater's production of Hairspray!  First time I've been in a play since high school; I'll bet Mom will be happy I'm using my singing voice again.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It's taking up a lot of my time, though.  Luckily two of my daughters are in the play, too, as ensemble.  So we go to a lot of practices together.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It hasn't cut into my exercise time, though.  I'm perfectly set up: I keep track of calories with <a href="http://loseit.com/">Lose It!</a>, I take a no-fall Aikido class during lunch hour twice a week (love it!), and I commute 6 miles each way by bicycle twice a week.  It's so integrated with my schedule, I can't miss.  Heck, I stopped tracking calories over the holidays and <b>still</b> lost two pounds.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I've also been invited to interview for Amazon.  What with the fiscal cliff, I'm thinking a non-government option might be worth having.  (I'm not worried for simulation: even if the public eventually realizes that we don't need a huge standing military, we'll want a way to train soldiers quickly and at minimal expense.  That's what simulation is all about.)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
To prepare for the interview, I'm studying up on my programming basics and completing at least one interview question every day.  I think I'll share the questions with you guys.  So every day you'll get a new brain teaser chosen from a site like <a href="http://www.techinterview.org/">techinterview</a> or <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a>.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Help me out: think you can do any better than my solutions?  Prove it!  I love learning, and this project promises something new every day!&#13;
