<p>Hurricane Fay finally made up her mind and decided to roll through Central Florida.  Since Omi and Opi live in Daytona, there's a possibility of flooding and power outages for them.  Since they're 85, we don't think they'll be able to make it down the 7 flights of stairs.&#13;

So we brought them over to our house!&#13;

Due to the "hurricane" (I think it's turned into a tropical storm now), and keeping track of kids and parents-in-law, I probably won't be online much for a week or so.&#13;
