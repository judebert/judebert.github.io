<p>It's a slow Friday here at work, so I entered a Fark photoshop.  I made Kim Jong Il the discoverer of the Time Cube, a proposition so thoroughly looney, explained in such a wretched way, that I shall not link to it here.  Google it for the most wasted time of your life, if you're so inclined.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Anyway, here's my <a href="/progress/fark/kji.gif" target="_blank">Kim Jong Il Fark Photoshop</a>.  Read more for other photoshops I've been holding out on.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>Foolish of you.  There's nothing here but crap.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Here's one from the "Religion Sponsored Sports Teams": <a href="/progress/fark/Amish_counterstrike_team.jpg" target="_blank">the Amish Counterstrike Team</a>.  It's an empty parking lot outside an Amish church.  Despite the inherent humor, and the lack of voting, the mods deleted it because it was unmodified.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Here's my entry for "Cracks": <a href="/progress/fark/klax_cracks.jpg" target="_blank">Klax Cracks</a>.  The phrase "Oh, I thought you said..." is somewhat traditional on Fark, although it brought me no votes this time.  Apparently no old-school arcade gamers frequent the photoshop contests.  And I worked hard on the interlacing, too.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The "Outlaw Dog" contest was particularly interesting, as my first extensive use of the stamp tool.  That's a nifty little device.  Here's <a href="/progress/fark/outlaw_5.jpg" target="_blank">Speed Racer's Mach 5 in the Outlaw's place</a>.  Not my best work, but apparently a very disappointing response nonetheless.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
They wanted us to photoshop this pilot.  I thought there were lots of lame entries.  I <a href="/progress/fark/pilot_2001.jpg" target="_blank">put the pilot in 2001</a>, but even lame competition couldn't get me any love.  Anybody know how to warp the image to conform to his helmet, especially using The Gimp?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
And last in the rolls of Fark Photoshop Failures, here's <a href="/progress/fark/umaga.jpg" target="_blank">famous Rugby player Umaga doing the Macarena</a>.  &#13;
