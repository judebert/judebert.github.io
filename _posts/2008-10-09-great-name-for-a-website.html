For years, I've been quoting a scientist who did research on economics with monkeys.  He found a currency for the monkeys that they would exchange for other goods, and measured how much was required to distract them from... well, whatever monkeys do in their spare time.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
What I've been quoting: "<i>There is no quantity of bananas</i> sufficient to distract a male monkey from the hindquarters of a female in estrus."  (Emphasis mine.)  Of course, I shorten it to its acronym, "TINQOB", in the same way that science-fiction fans do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TANSTAAFL">TANSTAAFL</a>.  I think tinqob.com would make a great name for a men's website.  &#13;

Turns out I've been quoting it wrong.  <a href="http://www.neuro.duke.edu/faculty/platt/">The scientist Michael Platt</a>, <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/54329?tid=relatedcl">was using juice, not bananas, for monkey currency.</a>  (The article covers a lot more.  I found it fascinating.)  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But TINQOJ just doesn't seem as memorable, to me.  &#13;
