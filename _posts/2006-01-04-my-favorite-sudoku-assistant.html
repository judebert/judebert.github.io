  content: "Carl, when do you have time to do Sudoku?   ;-) \r\n\r\nSeriously: yes,
    that seems possible.  It would be limited, since there's not much space on the
    Palm screen for pencil marks and the like.  I'll look into it after I'm done with
    Serendipity."

I've finally found <a href="http://www.paulspages.co.uk/sudoku/index.htm">the best Sudoku assistant</a> online.  It allows manual or automatic pencilmarks, imports other puzzles, and even uses CSS.  If I ever make my own, it'll probably be based on this, with the added ability to provide hints.&#13;
