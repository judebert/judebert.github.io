Would you like to buy an 'O'?  Round, and neat: a nearly perfect circle, tidy and complete...&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Seriously, I'm selling my EV.  I'm moving, and I don't have the time to fix it up and take it with me.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
<a href="/progress/EV/EV.html">The entire saga of Silent E's rise and fall</a> are detailed on this very site.  It's cost me more than $9000 to make, with around $7000 dollars of good parts in it.  Not to mention a new paint job.  I'm asking $5000.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
More details?  Sure, read on.&#13;

Silent E was built to be safe, reliable, and indistinguishable from a normal gasoline-burning car.  Driving this EV is virtually identical to driving any other stick-shift, with two caveats: you can't stall (seriously, it's impossible), and you should never over-rev an electric motor.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
She seats five people (and with its tall roof, they can all be adults) and has a big trunk in back.  I've used it to cart the whole family to the swimming pool, to get groceries, and to commute to work (6 miles each way, five days a week) in all kinds of weather.  It's quiet, smooth, and just downright enjoyable.&#13;

Silent E is a 1988 Honda Civic Wagon converted to a 144V electric vehicle.  Mechanically speaking, the engine was replaced with an Advanced DC 9" series-wound motor, the AWD shaft and differential were removed, the gas tank and other gasoline parts were removed, the power steering was replaced with a manual rack, and the clutch was upgraded to a lightweight racing clutch.  The only other mechanical modification was the new 15" aluminum rims with low-profile tires that very nearly exactly match the original 13" tire circumference (the speedometer still reads true).&#13;

New batteries will be required.  Silent E was originally outfitted with 12 Optima YellowTop D34 batteries.  8 of the batteries fit in the back, under the seat (which lifts up to reveal them); the other 4 are in a rack under the hood.  These batteries are the originals: before installation, they were left long enough to self-discharge, leading to damage that was never rectified.  On these batteries, the car got 12-15 miles on a single charge.  The current wiring uses the original automotive connectors: I believe this led to a persistent problem with power lines overheating and further ruining the batteries.  I recommend converting to marine/screw connectors.  Or lithium batteries, if you've got the money.&#13;

The charging system is a Manzanita Micro PFC-20, with a plain 15A plug mounted under the fuel door.  The car can be charged from practically any electrical outlet (and has been).  A 50-foot, bright yellow, 20A electrical cord is also included -- to charge from a conventional 15A plug, an adapter (or separate extension cord) will be required.  The batteries were outfitted with Rudman Regulators to protect from overcharging, but the remaining 8 regulators should not be considered reliable.  &#13;

<li>Battery management.  This will depend on the batteries you get.  Flooded golf cart batteries don't need them.

I'll include a 12V charger so you can charge the accessory battery separately, in case you don't want to buy this.  ($250)</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>&#13;
That's it.  For only $5000, you get about $5000 worth of EV parts, in a $1500 shell, ready to turn into a working EV: just add batteries.&#13;
