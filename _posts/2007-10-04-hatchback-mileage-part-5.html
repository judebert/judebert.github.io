<p>Ao-kun just reached 200,000 miles!
</p><p>
This is likely the last time I'll post anything about my Honda Civic Hatchback or his mileage.  Not because he's having trouble or anything: even as an old-timer, he's in excellent shape.  But I have to wait in line to drop off kids nowadays, and I can't really use pulse-and-glide so effectively in those cases.  It's hard to tell when to shut off the engine.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, I'm still getting consistently over 45MPG, sometimes as high as 50MPG.

Congratulations, Ao-kun!  16 years old, 200K miles, and still getting better mileage than a Prius!
