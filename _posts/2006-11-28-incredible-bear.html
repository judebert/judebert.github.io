<p>My wife just found this in her email.  It's a <a href="http://www.geekbase.org/squirrelproblem/">photo sequence showing a bear attacking a bird feeder</a>.  The catch?  The bird feeder is suspended above the ground on a line, and the bear practically tightrope-walks to get there.  That guy must use some space-age polymer to hang his bird feeder!&#13;
</p><p>  If you haven't seen this yet (it was apparently around at least as far back as March), you've got to go have a look!</p>
