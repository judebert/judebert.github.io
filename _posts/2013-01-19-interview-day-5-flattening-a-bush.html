<p>&#13;
Yesterday I made a linked list, in Java.  Yeah, that's right.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Today I'm taking on a programming problem: given a doubly-linked list (with head and tail), where any element may have a child doubly-linked list (without head and tail), flatten the structure into a doubly-linked list.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
That sounds vaguely tree-like, but trees don't usually have linked siblings.  It's all just parents and children. I'm calling this a bush.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Let's look at the structure.&#13;
</p><pre>&#13;
head-&gt;A&lt;=&gt;D&lt;=&gt;E&lt;=&gt;FC       G&#13;
                  |&#13;
                  H&#13;
&#13;
</pre><p>&#13;
Without being told where to put stuff, I could just tack it all on the tail.  But I think tacking it on after its parent is more elegant, if it can be implemented in similar complexity and space.  In the bush I drew, I'd like the nodes to end up in alphabetical order.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I might even be able to do this without recursion.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
I'll travel along the list, examining each node.  If it's got a child, I'll append the child to the parent.  Then I move to the next element.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
That screws up the double linking, though.  I could, on append, travel to the end of the child list, and adjust the links from there.  But then I have to visit all the children twice.  Well, that's not too bad; it increases the time complexity to O(2n), which is still linear, and storage stays O(1): all I need is a couple of pointers.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
On the other hand, if storage is not the biggest issue, I can use a <i>little</i> bit of recursion to get a faster implementation, which visits each node only once.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The recursive function flattenAndFindTail(Bush head) flattens the provided bush and returns the tail.  Basically, it just iterates down the bush, and calls flattenAndFindTail(node.child) on any bush that has a child.  It then inserts the whole flattened list between the parent and the parent's next sibling, using the returned tail to adjust the sibling's prev pointer.  Finally, it advances to the sibling, skipping the inserted list, because the inserted list has already been flattened.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
This works in O(n) time, rather than O(2n)... not a big improvement, but more efficient regardless.  Unfortunately, it takes up O(m) storage, where m is the maximum depth of the bush, in remembering a parent pointer for each recursive call.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
In cases where the depth of the bush is not expected to be large, I'd like to use the recursive function.  And I really like the elegance of flattening the child behind the parent; it's looks like the diagramming I did in English class.  I'll use an iterative method to create the array in main(), just to show off that I can do it both ways.&#13;

Pretty swanky, eh?  &#13;

Well, fine, then.  If you've got a better idea, I'd love to hear it!&#13;
