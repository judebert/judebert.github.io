<p>So, I just heard that Rumsfeld called critics of the Bush administration "morally or intellectually confused".  I got to hear a little snippet of the speech, too.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I must be the worst person in America.  I criticize the Bush administration constantly.  Actually, I criticize anyone in power constantly.  According to Rumsfeld, this makes me a Nazi.  Someone here is morally <b>and</b> intellectually confused.  But it's not me.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Morally: Correct me if I'm wrong (there's a nice little comment form on every article here, after all): this administration has consistently identified itself as Christian and appealed to Christian values.  Isn't that the religion with a commandment, "Thou shalt not kill?"  I don't remember any qualifications, but perhaps it's morally OK if it's for revenge, or to teach someone a lesson.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Intellectually: When we started bombing Iraq, it was because they had Weapons of Mass Destruction.  We never found any, so then we changed the reason to "Sadaam was a bad man."  When I change my reasoning to support the situation, it's intellectually dishonest; I'll allow "confused" as close enough.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
This is all very Orwellian.  How did criticism become "unpatriotic?"  How does wanting to verify that my leaders are doing the right thing make me a Nazi?  If I'm confused, that kind of language manipulation and <i>ad hominem</i> attack is why.&#13;
