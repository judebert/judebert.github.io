<p>I wrote this myself in an attempt to demonstrate my frustration with the Requirements Analysis phase of development on my current project. It's a humorous look of what the Bible doesn't tell you about the Flood.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
So God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So God said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the ground, man and beast and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them."&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But Mnzg the Requirements Analyst, although a picky sort of fella, found favor in the eyes of the Lord.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
And God said to Mnzg, "I have determined to make an end of all flesh; for the earth is filled with violence through them; behold, I will destroy them with the earth.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Make yourself an ark of gopher wood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch."&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
And Mnzg said to the Lord, "Your will be done.  I just wish I understood what you mean."&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
God explained, "I shall bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall die.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you."&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Mnzg replied, "Oooo, I like the way you say, 'shall.'  Could you elucidate on the ark a bit?"&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
And God said to Mnzg, "This is how you are to make it:  the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thrity cubits. &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above; and set the door of the ark in its side; make it with lower, second, and third decks.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female."&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Mnzg considered all this, and wrote it down.  Then he said unto the Lord, "So that I may perform an initial analysis, please review the following system requirements and inform me of any issues:&#13;
</p><p>&#13;

</p><p>&#13;
God looked upon the requirements, and Mnzg lost favor in the eyes of the Lord.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Then the Lord was heard to say, "I think I'll just go talk to Noah."&#13;
</p>&#13;
