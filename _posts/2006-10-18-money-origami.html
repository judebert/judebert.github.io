  <h4>Revised 2019-01-02</h4>
  <p>This used to point to http://members.cox.net/crandall11/, but that site is no longer available. The links have been updated to point to Origami Resource, where the pages have been preserved. Apparently these were created by Clay Randall.

<img align="left" src="https://www.origami-resource-center.com/images/xv6.jpg.pagespeed.ic.FmMZ4p0MMc.jpg" alt="Money Valentine" /><p>I'm cleaning out my e-mailbox, and I've come across this link of stuff I've always wanted to learn: <a href="https://www.origami-resource-center.com/money-origami.html">money origami</a>.  It has links to other money origami sites, too.  If I file it away, I'll lose it forever, so I figured it would go well here.</p>
