Yes, Boyd received a full scholarship to Berkeley and <em>blew it!</em>  &#13;
Unlike most Wasted Youth, however, Boyd managed to start something that's lasted a while: an a capella singing group.  &#13;
He's also worked in cool places like Netscape, and has an interesting sense of humor, all of which you can find at his home page.&#13;

Unfortunately, Boyd's home page is gone.  Nobody seems to be able to find him.&#13;
