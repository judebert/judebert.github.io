Yeah, like I wasn't wasting enough time already.  Fark notes that Scientology is sponsoring a NASCAR car, and wanted photoshops of other religion-sponsored sports teams.  While many ideas came to mind, the <a href="/progress/fark/hindu_roshambo.jpg">Hindu Roshambo champ</a> was my favorite.  The images were nearly impossible to find.  The "rock" hand was particularly hard to make.  About an hour and half of actual image editing, I'd guess.  <a href="http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=2107991">Vote for it on Fark!</a>
