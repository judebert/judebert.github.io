    work; just the basic OS.  The MSI Wind apparently does very well as a Hackintosh.

    install on a Mac-branded machine.

I'm about to embark on the adventure that is iPhone development.  I want to port and improve my <a href="/progress/palm/ctimer/ctimer.html">Contraction Timer</a>, and I have a few other interesting ideas as well.  
</p><p>
The only problem is that I'll need a Mac.  It needs to run Leopard, so a fairly new Mac.  The cheapest thing I can find is the Mac Mini; I could hook it up to my network and export its display to my other computers, so I wouldn't have to pay for a monitor.  Even with the discounts I can muster, that's still more than $500!  To port my software!
</p><p>
I wish the SDK would just install on Linux.  The thing is based off of BSD, for Heaven's sake!  I'd install BSD (at least dual-boot) to learn more programming.  
</p><p>
Anybody want to lend me a Mac for a few months?
