I know it's been a while; I've been busy!  The visit with Omi and Opi is over, and life has gone back to what passes for normal around here.
</p><p>
But the big attraction right now is my kids.
</p><p>
Tatiana graduated from 3 years of middle school with all straight As.  She's been working hard for that!  And her teachers awarded her the "good character" award for the second time.  Congratulations, Tatiana!
</p><p>
(I would also like to record for posterity that I have promised my daughter Tatiana that if she graduates from the 9th grade pre-IB program with straight As, and chooses to move on to the IB program, I will purchase her a laptop computer of modern specifications which she will continue to own until she drops out of the IB program.)
</p><p>
Melissa is moving on to middle school, again with straight As.  She scored the highest possible score on both her FCAT Writes and FCAT Reads: 5!  Congratulations, Melissa!
</p><p>
Kayla is attending Tuskawilla Montessori's 1st - 3rd grade class next year.  She's improved quite a lot in listening to her teachers.  She took some CATs this year, and fell in the 98th - 99th percentile in every category!  Her reading grade level is 3.5!  Congratulations, Melissa!
</p><p>
Congratulations, kids!  I'm proud of all of you!
