  content: Something could have been in or on the grass.  I let my piggies eat grass,
    but I've heard it can be hard on some of them.  I don't remember where I read
    that.  But look up guinea pigs and grass and you should be able to find something.  www.GuineaPigHome.com
    is an excellent website.

<p>Well, one of the guinea pigs died last night.  We have no idea why.  She was thin, but we thought she was just young.
</p><p>
We took them out to play in the grass today.  Both Sugar and Cinnamon were doing fine.  This evening, when Eri picked up Sugar, Sugar couldn't keep her balance, and fell on her side.  I ran to the computer to see what I could find, but by the time I got there, Sugar had made one last peep and died.
</p><p>
We hope PetSmart will do a post-mortem and tell us what happened, but they won't give us any guarantee.  They did give us another guinea pig, a calico we named Sundae.
</p><p>
We gave her the best home a guinea pig ever had for her short time with us.  She was skittish, but polite.  R.I.P, Sugar Anne Spice.  Best pet name ever.
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>And now, I have pictures.  NO, not sick ones.  Nice ones, of our two first guinea pigs.

<p>Of course, we knew they were social animals, so we bought a friend at the same time: Cinnamon.  I liked her markings even better.</p>

<p>Goodbye, Sugar.  We hardly knew ye.</p>
