<p>Well, perhaps my karma isn't so bad, after all.  My friend Richard -- the one with whom I've been carpooling, and who I stranded when Penny's water pump gave out -- needs help getting his two older cars working.  He's been injured, and he needs an automatic, so we revived his old Mercedes today.  It's been sitting for a year, but we just gave it a jump start.  Two tries later it was moving.  Those old diesels are tough: all it needed was a new battery.
</p><p>
Then we went to rescue his other car, an old Civic hatchback.  After four months of sitting, it started up with a jump, too.  He has no place to keep it, so I was happy to take it off his hands for a paltry sum.  
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>It's not too pretty, but it's in better shape than Penny was.  It's two years younger, but it has 15,000 extra miles on it!  It was a deal at the price anyway.  It needed some help with the starter circuit's clutch interlock switch (my wife learned how to push-start a car), but even with the mechanic's bill the cost is only up to $400 or so.  It'll need an A/C service, of course.

<u>2007-02-03</u>: One of the tires is in trouble, with a big bulge on the side.  I swapped it for one of the EV's tires, which fits perfectly.  It's a different max pressure than the existing tires, but everything seems to be working fine.

<u>2007-02-05</u>: After much consideration, and my wife's rejection of my favorite name ("Cielito", roughly Spanish for "sky boy"), I've decided to name it "Ao-kun", roughly Japanese for "little brother blue".  I consider it especially apropro, since my EV is an older, bigger Civic wagon.  Ah, the joys of Internet research!
