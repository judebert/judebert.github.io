It's a bit late, but no biggie: Eri and I spent her actual birthday together, in Disney.  There was a lot of walking, and a lot of hot.  But there was also a lot of fun, notably Splash Mountain and Tom Sawyer's Island.  We also got to watch the riverboat's steam engine at work.  &#13;

Lunch was fantastic, too.  We both had a lot of fun!&#13;
