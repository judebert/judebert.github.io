Well, I've transferred everything over to Serendipity, I've timestamped all the entries, and I'm ready to go.  It's time to remove the static pages that have been hiding my true identity... err... blog.  &#13;
<p><a id="extended"></a>There will probably be plenty of trouble while I modify templates.  Especially for people using <acronym title="Internet Exploder">The-Browser-That-Must-Not-Be-Named</acronym>, since I'm a <a href="http://getfirefox.com">FireFox</a> user, and it's not easy for me to check out broken CSS rendering on my IE-free box.  But I promise to always put back a working template after I'm done with the debugging.&#13;
