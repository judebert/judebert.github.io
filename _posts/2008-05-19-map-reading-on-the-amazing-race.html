<p>This is so funny, I <b>wish</b> I could claim it on my own.
</p><p>
My whole family loves The Amazing Race.  So much so, we're creating our own mini-Race for Melissa's birthday, completely contained in a local park.  
</p><p>
While searching for images of the envelopes to mimic, I came upon ab article where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Race_4">Steve and Dave, the Air Traffic Controllers from TAR4</a>, <a href="http://www.tarflies.com/article.php?_f=detail&amp;id=458&amp;tarfly=624ccb6af4d7f31d7b3989d94a7e56f0">explain why reading The Amazing Race maps is so difficult</a>.  Okay, I've always wondered, since the Racers appear to be so very navigationally challenged.
</p>
<p>
The funny bit is <a href="http://www.tarflies.com/images/stdv_holland.gif">this map of Holland</a>, which I've copied to my server in case theirs ever goes offline.  Check out the city names.  Those crazy producers!  No wonder nobody can read the maps!
