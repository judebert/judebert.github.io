<p>&#13;
This has been a difficult couple of weeks for everybody.  The whole family has been busy, and we haven't been getting to sleep on time because we've been checking out schools for next year.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But in spite of everything, Tatiana has still managed to keep her straight-A average and stay on the Honor Roll!  Today is the breakfast; I can't be there, but Eri is going.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Congratulations again, Tatiana!  We love you!&#13;
