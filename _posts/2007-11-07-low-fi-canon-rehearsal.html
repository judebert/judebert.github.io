<p><strong>This</strong> is why I need a better phone.  Its microphone <strong><em>SUCKS</em></strong>!  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
My niece is getting married, and since we have a family of violinists, we're considering playing Canon and/or the Bridal March for her.  We got together and Omi and Opi's house for a practice.  You can listen to <a href="/progress/media/videos/violin/Bridal_March_Practice.mpg" title="Bridal_March_Practice.mpg" target="_blank">this terrible recording of our duet practicing the Bridal March</a>, and <a href="/progress/media/videos/violin/Canon_Practice.mpg" title="Canon_Practice.mpg" target="_blank">this horrendous recording of our trio attempting Canon</a>... if you dare!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It's possible that the audio quality is so bad because I converted the video inappropriately.  (It sounds like microphone overload to me, but I'm new to this video stuff.)  If your computer understands my Treo's .3gp files (which is unlikely, but possible), you can try <a href="/progress/media/videos/violin/Bridal_March_Practice.3gp" title="Bridal_March_Practice.3gp" target="_blank">the phone recording of the Bridal March</a> and <a href="/progress/media/videos/violin/Bridal_March_Practice.3gp" title="Bridal_March_Practice.3gp" target="_blank">the phone recording of Canon</a>.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I warned you!&#13;
