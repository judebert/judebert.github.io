<p>I warned you before, I'm the Alpha Geek.  Here's more evidence.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
When my kids' computer's power supply failed (again), we were reminded once again why we don't buy non-standard equipment.  (I firmly believe the same should be applied to software.)  Rather than ordering the custom power supply, waiting more than a month for it to be delivered, and hooking everything back up, I did what any self-respecting geek would do: I ventured into the world of case mods.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>Okay, perhaps "case mod" is a little too generous for this.  I've cut chunks out of a case so a motherboard would fit; that's a case mod.  This is a MacGyver hack to get a computer back up using only the available materials.&#13;
</p>&#13;

<p>&#13;
As you can see from this photo, the original power supply is a long, narrow affair squeezed into the top of the case.  That matches exactly <i>nothing</i> available to the consumer.  What else would you expect from a Disney computer?  I mean, honestly?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Luckily, a friend of mine had an old 300W PS he was willing to give away.  It was just cluttering his house anyway.  (Thanks, <a href="http://to-live-free.com">Clayton</a>!)  Now the challenge is figuring out how to wedge it in here.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The first idea is to simply leave the power supply outside the case.  That's nixed by the wife.  So where else can it fit?&#13;
</p>&#13;

  <figcaption>How about here?<br /><a href="/progress/media/photos/geek_ps/geekps_new_fit_big.jpg">(2160 x 1440)</a></figcaption>

<p>This could work.  It's conveniently located, there's enough space, and it even provides a hole for the power cable and space for the fans.  The only problem is that it covers all the expansion slots.  I don't use those anyway.  This looks like the place!  But how will I mount it?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I suppose I could drill and tap a few holes.  But that would be a pain.  There's an easier way, surely?  Sure there is: zipties!  But will they fit under the power supply?&#13;
</p>&#13;
<br style="clear: both;" />&#13;

Sure, they'll fit right between the PCI slots!  It's gonna take a few of them, but by cleverly joining them at the corners to provide nice, 90-degree angles, everything should work out fine.&#13;
</p>&#13;

<p>&#13;
And here you see the whole thing, ready to be plugged in.  It's lopsided.  That's because zip ties don't really provide outstanding support, even when they're pulled tight.  But the fan can push the air around, and the power cable can be inserted.  In fact, the sides go back on easily, too.  30 minutes of hacking later, the kids have a computer to use, and I can use my Debian Linux box in peace.&#13;
