<p>In <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565%20">"I've Got Nothing to Hide" and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy</a>, Daniel Solove discusses the issues involved with privacy violations.  He does a rather thorough job, although it may be a little too objective for some people.  There's just not a lot of drama there.
</p><p>
He discusses that, too.
</p><p>
Here are the 5 main points I took away:
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>"Privacy" is a vague term.  It's not easy to define, and years of discussion haven't made it any clearer.  So instead of trying to nail down a <b>definition</b>, let's come up with a <b>description</b> instead.  That way we can address the actual problems, instead of ignoring them or clumping them together while we fight over the definition.
</p>
<p>
With that in mind, here's a list of problems that could be considered "privacy" problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Information Collection
<ul>
       <li>Surveillance</li>
       <li>Interrogation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information Processing
<ul>
       <li>Aggregation</li>
       <li>Identification</li>
       <li>Insecurity</li>
       <li>Secondary Use</li>
       <li>Exclusion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information Dissemination
<ul>
       <li>Breach of Confidentiality</li>
       <li>Disclosure</li>
       <li>Exposure</li>
       <li>Increased Accessibility</li>
       <li>Blackmail</li>
       <li>Appropriation</li>
       <li>Distortion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Invasion
<ul>
       <li>Intrusion</li>
       <li>Decisional Interference</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
We can at least agree that these are all problems, even if we think some of them should be filed under a different heading.  Personally, I think "Privacy Problems" is pretty good.

</li>
<li>
<p>
Privacy isn't necessarily about benefit to an individual.  Privacy for individuals is a benefit to society.  When you allow society to intrude on the privacy of individuals, you're hurting the society.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Privacy problems aren't generally dramatic.  They involve power shifts, or preventing behaviors (even legal ones), which can be very difficult to quantify.  It's still important; perhaps more so, since it actually damages society.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When someone says, "I have nothing to hide," they're only thinking of "surveillance" as a privacy problem.  Warrantless wiretapping (like the NSA actions) actually causes <b>several</b> of the problems in the list above.  Whether you have something to hide or not, those actions are damaging society and should be dealt with.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
"Dealing with" it isn't necessarily stopping it.  A limitation would be just fine; for instance, requiring the wiretappers to justify their surveillance to an impartial third party, such as a judge.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
All of this makes perfect sense to me.  Comments?
