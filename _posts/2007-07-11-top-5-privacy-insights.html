<p>In <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565%20">"I've Got Nothing to Hide" and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy</a>, Daniel Solove discusses the issues involved with privacy violations.  He does a rather thorough job, although it may be a little too objective for some people.  There's just not a lot of drama there.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
He discusses that, too.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Here are the 5 main points I took away:&#13;
</p><ol>&#13;
<li>
<p>"Privacy" is a vague term.  It's not easy to define, and years of discussion haven't made it any clearer.  So instead of trying to nail down a <b>definition</b>, let's come up with a <b>description</b> instead.  That way we can address the actual problems, instead of ignoring them or clumping them together while we fight over the definition.&#13;
</p>
<p>&#13;
With that in mind, here's a list of problems that could be considered "privacy" problems:&#13;
</p>
<ul>&#13;
<li>Information Collection&#13;
<ul>&#13;
       <li>Surveillance</li>&#13;
       <li>Interrogation</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>Information Processing&#13;
<ul>&#13;
       <li>Aggregation</li>&#13;
       <li>Identification</li>&#13;
       <li>Insecurity</li>&#13;
       <li>Secondary Use</li>&#13;
       <li>Exclusion</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>Information Dissemination&#13;
<ul>&#13;
       <li>Breach of Confidentiality</li>&#13;
       <li>Disclosure</li>&#13;
       <li>Exposure</li>&#13;
       <li>Increased Accessibility</li>&#13;
       <li>Blackmail</li>&#13;
       <li>Appropriation</li>&#13;
       <li>Distortion</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>Invasion&#13;
<ul>&#13;
       <li>Intrusion</li>&#13;
       <li>Decisional Interference</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
We can at least agree that these are all problems, even if we think some of them should be filed under a different heading.  Personally, I think "Privacy Problems" is pretty good.&#13;
&#13;
</li>
<li>
<p>&#13;
Privacy isn't necessarily about benefit to an individual.  Privacy for individuals is a benefit to society.  When you allow society to intrude on the privacy of individuals, you're hurting the society.&#13;
</p>&#13;
</li>
<li>
<p>&#13;
Privacy problems aren't generally dramatic.  They involve power shifts, or preventing behaviors (even legal ones), which can be very difficult to quantify.  It's still important; perhaps more so, since it actually damages society.&#13;
</p>&#13;
</li>
<li>
<p>&#13;
When someone says, "I have nothing to hide," they're only thinking of "surveillance" as a privacy problem.  Warrantless wiretapping (like the NSA actions) actually causes <b>several</b> of the problems in the list above.  Whether you have something to hide or not, those actions are damaging society and should be dealt with.&#13;
</p>&#13;
</li>
<li>
<p>&#13;
"Dealing with" it isn't necessarily stopping it.  A limitation would be just fine; for instance, requiring the wiretappers to justify their surveillance to an impartial third party, such as a judge.&#13;
</p>&#13;
</li>
</ol>&#13;
<p>&#13;
All of this makes perfect sense to me.  Comments?&#13;
