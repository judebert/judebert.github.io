</figure>&#13;
<p>You may remember <a href="/progress/EV/I-Hate-Rust.html">I fixed a rust spot some time ago.</a>  It was on the body, just past the corner, but the corner had a bit of rust, too.  I painted both the corner and a rectangular bit of the body.  I let Melissa mask off a bit of the corner in the shape of a lightning bolt, and we painted that bit yellow.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
As you can see from the picture, the masking was incomplete.  But the kids think it looks "more electric", so it's cool.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Two weekends later, I repaired the rest of the rust.  To make the job look consistent (as opposed to "black patches"), I painted the portion of the hatch that runs between the two corners.  To make it look cool, I painted it black and yellow, like a caution tape.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Read on for the other pictures.&#13;

There ya go.  I sanded, added some body filler to a low spot, sanded, primered, sanded lightly, goofed up, resanded, reprimered, and sanded <i>very</i> lightly.  I laid down blue tape at an angle over the entire area.  Then I removed every 3rd and 4th strip.  I painted it yellow and waited overnight for the paint to dry.  &#13;
<p>&#13;
Then I removed the remaining blue tape, put new tape down over the yellow stripes, and painted everything remaining black.  I figured the black would cover any yellow areas I had missed better than the yellow would have covered the black.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I waited overnight for the paint to dry, removed the tape, and reassembled my hatch.  You see the results.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Not too shabby.  I hoped that my method would make a nice smooth surface, but there are ridges at every stripe.  There's also no clear coat.  Oh, well; it's not like it's professional.  It looks unique, and it effectively ends any concerns over rust on the hatch.  &#13;
