<p>Yes, my wife actually said that.  For geeky reasons: I fixed her screensaver.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
She uses the Weather Underground screensaver, and ever since she got her new computer (that I made for her), it hasn't worked.  Big, blank screen.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I kept telling her that I don't do Windows anymore, and that she should call Microsoft or Weather Underground for support.  She eventually sent Weather Underground an email.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
At the same time, I was learning some programming stuff that got me a little confused.  I had given up for the day, but after lunch I came back ready to go, and said, "I'm ready to get cracking on this problem."  She queried, "You mean my screensaver?"&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
"No, I mean my programming problem," I responded.  "Why don't you send Weather Underground an email?"&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
"I did," she said, and then proceeded to use the Wife Code on me: "That's OK, just go ahead and work on your stuff.  I'll wait for the email."&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I've been married 17 years now, and I've learned a thing or two.  For the unobservant, she actually said, "You ought to work on my problem instead of your fun thing."&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So I went to look at her screensaver.  It's supposed to retrieve weather images from the Weather Underground website and display them as a slideshow.  We figured there was a network problem.  I'd had her disable Windows Firewall earlier, but I've done tech support before, so I tried it again myself.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The screensaver still didn't work.  And I couldn't find anything else causing the problem, either: she'd already disabled all her adblocking and malware scanning stuff.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So I said I didn't know what the problem was.  She used the Wife Code again: "That's OK.  Don't worry about it.  I'll just wait."&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Another translation, for the unobservant: "Don't you even think about quitting now, or there'll be trouble."&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So I decided to bring in the big guns.  I started channelling the Alpha Geek.  He downloaded <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, a network sniffer, and installed it.  Then I started capturing and ran the screensaver.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It was making a connection with no problem.  In fact, it was downloading some screensaver.swf or something!  It was just a plain HTTP connection, and the URL was sitting right there in my capture log.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I put aside the bad design and security implications of running a Flash program as a screensaver and concentrated on how to get this problem off my back.  Putting the URL into Firefox loaded the slideshow with no problems.  That was the Aha Moment.  I figured that Windows was probably hardcoded to use Internet Exploder for all its networking needs.  And obviously, since I had built the computer, nobody had needed IE, so it wasn't configured with a Flash plugin!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Sure enough, loading the URL in IE gave me a plugin problem.  So I installed Flash, and the slideshow appeared in IE.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But not in the screensaver.  It gave me a dialog saying "This program needs the Macromedia Flash."  I put aside the bad grammar and concentrated on how to get this problem off my back.  :)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
A reboot didn't do it.  But a quick Google search found the problem: the plugin installed Flash9.ocx, but external programs were looking for Flash.ocx.  I copied the file (because the plugin would still be looking for the file named Flash9.ocx) and renamed it.  Then the screensaver worked without a hitch!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It was at this point that my wife declared me a god.  It was a little flattering, I must say.  And largely undeserved.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Then I got back to the really important stuff: learning GNU autotools.&#13;
</p>
