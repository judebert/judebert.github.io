<p>Thanks to everyone who has expressed their good wishes for Kayla's recovery.  It's amazing how quickly kids heal; she'll probably have a walking cast in a week or so.&#13;

I'm still swamped, but I thought I'd write a little something to let you know I'm not completely ignoring you.  More Serendipity, Electric Vehicle, and other stuff in a week or two, I'm sure.&#13;
