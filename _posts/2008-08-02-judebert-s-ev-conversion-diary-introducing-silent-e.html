<p>I am pleased to announce the entry of my electric vehicle, <i>Silent E</i>, to the ranks of daily drivers.  We've driven to work two days in a row.
</p><p>
Today I went to get a new license plate decal, because I lost the old one.  $17, including the $1 credit card fee (I always thought that was illegal).  Since I was out in such ideal light, I took pictures!

Here's the virtual tour of my electric Honda Civic Wagon!

<p>I couldn't get a picture of the driver's side alone, since there was a car there.  And there was landscaping directly in front.  And there are loads of blemishes that I don't feel like publishing.
</p><p>
From now on, this is my daily driver.  I've already taken it to work twice.
