    for the past two weeks, but I figured it would clear up on its own. I guess I
    need to man up and go to the doctor. I'm just wary of doctors. Those blood-stealing
    bloodsuckers always wanna steal my blood for their hocus pocus rain dances."

Virtually nothing got done this weekend.  Starting Thursday, I had terrible... gastrointestinal problems.  Yeah, let's just leave it at that.  Saturday was the kids' swim meet, where I got such a sunburn that I broke out in hives.  This, despite using SPF 50 sunscreen.  By the end of Saturday, the digestive problems were mostly resolved (O.M.G.), but I was itchy and peeling.  Sunday I still had hives on the sunburn, and I started getting little pimples.  Tatiana spiked a fever and felt nauseous, which didn't help the trip to and from Daytona at all.  I largely resisted the urge to scratch.  Then, this morning, I woke up with eyes so puffy they were hard to open.   The doctor prescribed a steroid, an antihistamine, and an antibiotic.

And that, friends, is the definition of a rough weekend.  No pictures, because, really, nobody wants to see that.
