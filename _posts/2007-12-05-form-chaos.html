  content: Well on top of buying supplies for the school and classroom, the gifts
    are no longer going to be from individuals but from the mass.  Hmm While I think
    it is far easier to make the gift from everyone (due to the fact that some children
    may not be able to contribute so we just add all the money and make a gift) it
    is less personal in my opinion.

  content: Yes, things are getting less and less personal all the time.  I just love
    that the form mail includes "My how time does fly!"

<p>Apparently the school system has long known that holidays are hectic.  I got this hilarious form letter about giving a holiday gift to one of our teachers.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dear Parents,
</p>
<p>
(Event/Holiday) is approaching.  My how time does fly!  We would like to do something from the children to (Teacher's name).  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are more blanks that need to be hand-filled, of course.  I'd write the rest of the letter for you, but I've got to go.  My, how time does fly!
