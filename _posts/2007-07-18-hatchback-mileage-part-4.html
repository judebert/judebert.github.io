<b>I've done it again!</b>  That's three times in a row; I don't think this can be considered a fluke.  <b>54.16 MPG</b> in my Civic Hatchback.  &#13;

I'm going to run one more tank before I start making modifications.  A tune-up, an air filter with better flow, and synthetic oil are definitely on the table.  A fella I respect has been experimenting with his Corvette (!) and swears he got a 10% boost from a product called "SweetShooter".  Originally intended to coat gun barrels to keep them from getting fouled by black powder, it has been used in oil and gas to coat the cylinders.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Heck, if he can risk his Corvette, I can I can offer my HB.  it's a dirt-simple mod, and I can even have it ready before the next tank.  60 MPG, here I come!&#13;
