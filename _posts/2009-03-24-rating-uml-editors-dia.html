  content: You can also have a look at <a href="http://www.easyumleditor.com">EasyUML Editor</a>.
    It is also a nice portal which can generate UML Diagrams from easy to use Textual
    notations.

  content: I did see that, but I'll have to look at it more closely sometime.  I admit
    the idea is intriguing; almost like programming a UML diagram.

  content: "I want to design some small database apps just for my personal use, so
    want free tools.  I use a small Windows7 \r\n\r\nplatform, so nothing heavy-weight
    like Eclipse.\r\n\r\nI was thinking to use HSQLDB and some article said it was
    a good idea to use a UML tool called 'Dia' to do the \r\n\r\ntoplevel ERD design,
    which would link into a tool called 'tedia2sql' to validate my design, and actually
    build the \r\n\r\ndatabase in the target RDBMS.- i.e an small IDE.  Some hope
    !\r\n\r\nAlthough Inkscape covered all my drawing needs until now, it has no UML
    support, so as Dia had promise of the \r\n\r\nabove, I installed it and drew my
    20+ table ERD.  But I was then unable to find a working tool to generate SQL \r\n\r\ncode
    from the Dia file, or even validate the drawing was a correct ERD.  My 'ERD' currently
    stands in isolation, \r\n\r\nunable to test or use. I have spent weeks searching
    the web for alternatives, >95% UML articles are for non-SQL \r\n\r\ntargets. OMG,
    the controlling body, states UML is tailored to the target system using 'Standard
    Profiles', but \r\n\r\nhave not defined a Standard Profile for SQL !!  I imagine
    lack of a common SQL Profile is a big hindrance using \r\n\r\nUML for db design.
    \  \r\n\r\nI am a complete a newbie to UML modelling.  Last time I designed a
    db, UML didnt exist, all I knew was simple 1:1, \r\n\r\n1:n, N;M relations, which
    as I remember was sufficient. I gather only a very small subset of UML, and only
    the \r\n\r\n'Class' diagram is needed to make a ERD. Dont think I need complexity
    of ObjectOrientation, 3NF sufficient.\r\n\r\nObviously I would prefer NOT to have
    to redraw my 20+ tables from scratch, but I see Dia has limited export \r\n\r\nformats,
    its default being XML - no XMI.  It can export to SVG - which I tested works fine
    in Inkscape - but I \r\n\r\nguess SVG contains no UML data, so maybe no use for
    code generation ?  Dia can export to Visio format - is there a \r\n\r\nway I can
    export to Visio, then re-export into XMI for importing into a better Editor ?\r\n
    \r\nWhen I originally read the recomendation to use UML for the toplevel db design,
    my expectation was to be able to \r\n\r\nvalidate the Class Diagram, then automatically
    create the db in the target RDBMS - in my case HSQLDB.\r\n\r\nToday I came across
    'Open modelsphere', and seeing from its user manual it had Validation, ODBC &
    JDBC connections \r\n\r\nto at least Oracle, Informix, MySQL (couldn't see a 'Dataheet'
    or 'Specification' on their site) having read their \r\n\r\nlink to 'Software
    Review' was about to spend time evaluating it, when I thought to google more reviews
    of it, and \r\n\r\ncame across your disparaging review dated 2009. \r\n\r\nI like
    the requirements criteria you expressed, but I do need ERD-to-targetSQL, dont
    need 'Sequence'.\r\n\r\nOpen Modelsphere has had 2 releases since then - which
    I hope fix some of your criticisms.\r\n\r\nI imagine the market has changed in
    last 3 years.  Any chance of you updating that review, and perhaps reviewing \r\n\r\nother
    open source Design Tools that can complete more of the steps in progressing an
    ERD to db build ?\r\n\r\nI thank you in advance for any assistance you can give."

  content: "Paul,\r\n\r\nI'm actually considering a new review format, which would
    allow you to compare the entries based on your own criteria.  Of course, the review
    would need to include the criteria you want to sort by; if I ever get around to
    doing it, I'll be sure to include SQL workflow in the list.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid
    I do all my SQL by hand, so I'm not familiar with any tools that take UML to SQL.
    \ Sorry I couldn't help you."

I'm still <a href="/progress/archives/329-Rating-UML-Editors.html">looking for a UML editor that fits my criteria</a>, and I'm not stopping until I find one!  Today I tried <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/dia/">Dia</a>, another Open Source editor recommended by Ubuntu's package manager.  
</p><p>
Unfortunately, Dia is really a drawing program with UML objects, not a UML editor.  Let's look at the details.
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>
<u>Class and Sequence Diagrams:</u> <b>Poor.</b>  Class diagrams are simple to create and modify.  Sequence diagrams... not so much.  They have multiple problems that I'll go into in more detail; for now, let's just say that drawing class diagrams is fantastically easy, but sequence diagrams is rather difficult.
</p><p>
<u>Configurable Display:</u> <b>Very Good.</b>  You'd expect a drawing program to be configurable, and Dia is.  You can change colors to your heart's content, modify fonts and styles, and generally modify anything.  It goes a little deeper than that, though:  Dia's UML tools provide a myriad of options that modify your diagram in compliance with UML standards.
</p><p>
Of course, there are a lot of possibilities in the UML standards, and supporting them all takes a lot of dialog space.  Dia does a good job of hiding the complexity, mostly by using separate tabs for operations and attributes.  I think it could benefit from some context sensitivity, but I was never frustrated by creating a new element.
</p><p>
<u>Group Selection and Movement:</u> <b>Fair.</b>  In class diagrams, Dia provides outstanding group selection and movement.  In fact, it works just like a drawing tool.  Alignment is easy, too.  In sequence diagrams, things get a little harder.  Dia can't move the lifelines around as a group.  Stuff gets unstuck and has to be rerouted.  The process bars aren't resized when new method calls are made, and there's no attempt to keep the message lines straight.
</p><p>
<u>Infinite Undo:</u> <b>Outstanding!</b>  Dia seems to have an infinite undo queue.  I never ran into any problems with it.  
</p><p>
<u>Supports Synchronous, Asynchronous, and Reflexive Messages:</u> <b>Fail.</b>  There is no way to generate a reflexive message arrow.  Since Dia provides all the standard drawing tools, you might be able to fake it; I tried, but the arrow kept going the wrong way.  I need reflexive messages.
</p><p>
<u>Dynamic Document Size:</u> <b>Great.</b>  There was a moment when I thought I'd be hampered by page limits.  However, selecting past the viewport boundary quickly dispelled that idea.  After that, I had no trouble adding classes or lifelines past the boundary.
</p><p>
<u>Scrolling:</u> <b>Unsatisfactory.</b>  Dragging a selection past the boundaries causes Dia to scroll, but you're better off using the scrollbars.  Connecting message arrows to off-screen classes was a pain; there was no scrolling, so I had to either zoom out or make the connection in multiple steps.  Either way, there was no way to be certain that the line was actually straight.
</p><p>
<u>Shared Data Model:</u> <b>Fail.</b> Dia is just a drawing program, not a UML editor.  There is <em>NO DATA MODEL</em>.  While this makes creating quick diagrams easy, it makes maintenance a nightmare.  
</p><p>
<u>Supports Large Projects:</u> <b>Fail.</b>  Since there's no data model, there's no import capability.  There's also no consistency.  Your large project is nothing but a stack of diagrams, with no enforcement of consistency, uniqueness, or relatedness.  I suppose you could say that Dia supports large projects, since you can create all the diagrams you want.  But that's a little disingenuous, I think.
</p><p>
For niceties, Dia has the best alignment and spacing tools I've seen yet (although it doesn't have ArgoUML's "Broom").  The orthogonal inheritance lines were no problem, even when I stacked the dashed lines up.  Image saving was a breeze, and it saved only the portion of the diagram that was actually populated.  While I thought the styles were a little large and blocky, they're ideal for projecting to a room full of programmers during peer review: readable from the back.  And if I really didn't like it, I could've changed the styles.
</p><p>
<u>Final Verdict:</u>  Dia is a drawing tool, much as its name implies.  It has some nice UML elements, particularly with respect to class diagrams.  If I ever need to whip up a class diagram for somebody, I might reach for Dia.  But with its poor sequence diagram functionality and utter lack of a data model, I can't possibly use it for my serious work.
