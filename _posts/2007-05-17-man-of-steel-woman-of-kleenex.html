<p>I know, I'm late again. I'm digging up all kinds of old Internet lore. This one is from one of my favorite authors, Larry Niven. It's his essay on <a href="http://www.larryniven.org/stories/Man_of_Steel_Woman_of_Kleenex.shtml">the trouble with Superman and Lois having kids</a>. Worth a read, even if only for purile humor.</p>
