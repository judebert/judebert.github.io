It seems I'm climbing down the prestige vehicle ladder: electric car, gas car, scooter, and now bicycle.  I was having real problems with... ummm... how to put it delicately?... the bicycle saddle.  Yeah.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I just spent a week traveling for work, and it's done me a world of good.  I could barely even feel the saddle when I climbed on the bike this morning, and I was still in pretty good shape when I got to work.&#13;

I think I may be insufficiently hydrated, though: my heart rate kept rocketing up.  At least that's a lot easier to fix than a bicycle saddle!&#13;
