<p>&#13;
The holiday always keep me busy, but this one has been particularly active.  I was under a deadline to incorporate my new functionality in Serendipity (I'll tell you more about that when it's through).  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The day before the deadline, as I worked between family obligations -- and with three kids, there are <b>lots</b> of family activities -- my hard drive failed.  We had left to visit family, and when we got back all the computers had rebooted except mine.  Possibly a lightning strike, who knows?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
My new task was to get all my important data off the hard drive.  Years of email, bookmarks, development files, photos, music... everything would be lost if I couldn't restore it.  I was getting the dreaded "interrupt lost" error, but I had high hopes that the problem was the motherboard: the DVD drive, also on the secondary bus, was having intermittent problems, too.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Before dealing with my odd setup -- the relic of multiple installs and operating systems, including a stint as a dual-boot Windows/Linux machine -- I cleaned the machine with a vacuum.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
That was obviously a mistake.  A few hours later, just as I was finally detecting the light at the end of the tunnel, there was a giant spark and "ZORCH!" noise.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
The computer shut down in mid-boot.  The smell of burning electronics filled the air.  My heart sank into my shoes.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
All is not lost.  I have another power supply; if that's the only problem, I'm good.  I also have an old computer that I could shuffle the drives into; Linux is pretty flexible, so I might manage to get things running there.  I have a few spare motherboards lying around, too, and they might come in handy as deplorably slow replacements.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The big problem is <i>time</i>.  I just don't know if I'll have the time to try stuff out.  Until I manage to get a handle on the problem, I'm stuck using the kids' computer for everything... and it's only available during the late-night hours.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Well, I'm off to bed.  If I manage to destroy any more equipment, I'll let everybody know.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I hope your New Year is a lot less zorchy than mine!&#13;
