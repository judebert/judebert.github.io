  <figcaption>One Tank</figcaption>

<p>I filled up on Friday.  533.3 miles on this tank, using the hypermiler's "Pulse &amp; Glide" technique.  The tank wasn't even empty!
</p><p>
10.02 gallons.  That's <b>53.3 MPG!</b>  Better than a Prius.  My wife is impressed (and after all, I only do it to get chicks).  My dad wasn't so impressed.  
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>
Afterwards, I refilled the tires, which were down about 5 PSI.  I still need an alignment and a tune-up.  I bet I could get 60 on this.
</p><p>
I've only had one problem with other drivers.  In general, they just race around me and screech to a halt at the next red light.  (I'm sure it's frustrating when I pass them in the slow lane.)  I finally had one guy honk at me, though.  It was part of a long coast to the light, and he honked a second time as he turned into his residential area.
</p><p>
I now want two bumper stickers: "Driving like this gets me <b>53 MPG</b>" (preferably with changeable numbers), and "If you don't like it, <b>PASS ME!</b>".
