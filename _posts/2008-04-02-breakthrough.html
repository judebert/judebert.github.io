<p>&#13;
I've been kinda depressed for about a week now.  I'm trying to reuse some existing code, but it fails.  The code is incomprehensible.  I've given it my full effort and attention for a whole week -- I've even dreamed about it.  But, as my brother would say, it's been kicking my ass.  I describe this kind of problem as a "brick wall".  And I've been pounding my head against it repeatedly.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Today I finally fixed it!  I beat the code!  Everything is working smoothly; the sun is shining, the birds are birdsing, and all is once again right with the world.  With luck, I'll have some time (and will) to work on Serendipity or geek some broken stuff.&#13;

The amazing thing is the emotional change.  I've been suffering from headaches, lack of energy, and general depression.  I've been grouchy (Eri noticed).  I felt utterly defeated.  But now that I've figured out this problem, I'm ecstatic, nearly euphoric.  I'm not an idiot!  I pounded my head against the giant brick wall and it fell!&#13;

Proving once again that my head is thicker than stone.   8-) &#13;
