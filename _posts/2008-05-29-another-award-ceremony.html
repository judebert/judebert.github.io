To cap off our busy day, we enlisted our good friends for last-minute babysitting and went to Tatiana's award ceremony.   Many of the students received awards, including national recognition.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Tatiana received several mathematics awards.  Okay, 18th place in the Florida Math League isn't as good as last year's 2nd place, but it's still plenty impressive!  Figure that out in terms of percentages, and you're talking about the top 1% of the top 1%.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But the big achievement, for which she received a small trophy, was two years of straight A report cards.  Congratulations, Tatiana!&#13;
