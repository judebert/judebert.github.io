You may think that, since I live in Florida, I don't really need the heater I put in my EV.  I spent extra money and a <b>lot</b> of Nathan's time and effort replacing the old heat exchanger with a ceramic heater.  (I could have put two in that space, but it's not like I live in Alaska or anything.)  
</p><p>
I was just being cautious.  But today I found out <i>why</i> every EV <b>needs</b> a heater.
</p><p>
Fog.
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>
That's right.  It was pretty chilly for Florida: 42F.  There was fog all over the road.  Inevitably, my windshield misted up.
</p><p>
I've miswired my heater somehow, but it turns on when I have the fan at Speed 1 and turn the ignition key all the way over to "crank".  It stays on until I bump the fan speed up.
</p><p>
And boy, was I grateful I figured that out!  The heater took care of my misty windshield in no time.
</p><p>
Yes, you curious people, it does affect my range.  It drains almost 20A sometimes!  But today it seemed to be having huge effects, and I couldn't figure out why.
</p><p>
Turns out I was driving with my parking brake on.
</p><p>
So, in conclusion: put a heater in your EV.  Make sure it can point at your windshield.
</p><p>
And release the parking brake.
