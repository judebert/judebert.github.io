<p>It scared me to death when I heard the bedroom door open.  The latch clicked loudly and the hinges creaked.  It sounded like someone had burst in.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
No problem, though: it's just Mimi.  She was unable to open the door by pushing or scratching, and she figured she was entitled to be in any room (it is HER HOUSE, after all), so she just jumped up and pulled the handle down.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We've never actually seen her jump for the handle, but we have pretty good circumstantial evidence.  Eri once saw the handle moving while she was reading Kayla to sleep.  Then Mimi walked in.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
If cats ever evolve thumbs, we're in serious trouble.&#13;
