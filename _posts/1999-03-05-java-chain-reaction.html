<p>Here's one of my first Java apps. It uses Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm to draw pieces of lines as particles and simulate a nuclear chain reaction.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
Below you should see a 100 by 100 window.  Within are atoms &#13;
(the raised circles - Java draws horrible circles).  Soon a particle &#13;
(small dot) should appear in the center, moving in a random direction.  &#13;
Whenever it hits an atom, the atom undergoes fission, becoming four &#13;
particles.  (The original particle is annihilated.)&#13;

<p>&#13;
The particles are interesting because they move using an implementation &#13;
of Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm, rather than the standard &#13;
velocity increments.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
One benefit of using Bresenham's for particle movement is the automatic &#13;
trails.  The velocity of a "Bresenham particle" is expressed as a number &#13;
of pixels.  Each turn, the particle is stepped <i>velocity</i> times.  &#13;
This allows each pixel to be drawn, resulting in a trail.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Stemming from this is another advantage: better collision checking.  &#13;
With the standard velocity increments, a particle whose velocity is &#13;
larger than the width of an atom could step right over the atom and &#13;
never collide with it.  A Bresenham particle actually calculates each &#13;
intervening pixel, and so you can check at each step.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Finally, the direction of a Bresenham particle is not limited like &#13;
a velocity particle with integer components.  A velocity particle can &#13;
only travel at integer ratios depending on its max speed.  For &#13;
instance, if the max speed of its X or Y velocity is 2, then there are &#13;
only five directions it can go: x, y, x + y, x + 2y, and 2x + y.  &#13;
(Note that 2x + 2y is the same as x + y.)  You could increase this &#13;
to 18 directions by allowing it to go in negative directions.  &#13;
However, a Bresenham particle simply begins at a point and goes in the &#13;
direction of some arbitrary point, limiting its angles depending only &#13;
on the pixel width and height of the screen.&#13;
