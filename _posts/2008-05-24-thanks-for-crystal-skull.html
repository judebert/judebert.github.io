<a href="/progress/archives/221-Thanks-for-Horton.html">My semi-anonymous donor did it again.</a>  I really don't think I deserve this, but how can I refuse?  If there's anything better than taking the whole family out to a movie, it's taking the family out to a movie on somebody else's dime.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We went to see <i>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i>.  Since it's not appropriate for Kayla, we arranged a sleepover for her.  There was also an odd group-date thing going on with one of my eldest daughter's friends, and she was along as a pseudo-chaperon, so we put all the parents together, too.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It was a lot of fun.  The opening puts a gigantic strain on the suspension of disbelief, but we didn't go for the realism.  The adventure, on the other hand, was everything <i>Indy</i> promises with each new movie.&#13;

Afterwards we went to a restaurant for dessert; eventually everybody wound up in the same place and we combined our tables (much to our waitresses' chagrin).  At one point my Dread Reading Addiction took over: the television over my friend's shoulder was closed-captioned, and I couldn't help but read it, even though it was college girls' softball.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I wound up missing big chunks of the conversation for a few minutes.  When they discovered the problem, our wives ridiculed me for the program content.  Luckily, my friend Jim came to my rescue, explaining that I was merely "enthralled by the crystal skull".  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Ah, yet another appropriate euphemism for television.&#13;

On the way home, the kids piled into a photo booth.  Other Jim paid for it.  "Best three bucks I ever spent!", he insists.  I can't see how I could possibly argue.&#13;
