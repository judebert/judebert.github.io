<p><a href="/progress/EV/Independence-Day.html">I've always considered Independence Day to be Silent E's birthday.</a>  &#13;
</p>&#13;
This makes it her third, and I'm sorry to say it hasn't been a happy one.  <a href="/progress/archives/392-Judeberts-EV-Conversion-Diary-Meltdown.html">The most recent battery problem</a> has sidelined her while I decide what to do next.&#13;
<p>&#13;
Obviously, the right thing to do is to replace the battery pack.  But the original pack suffered from two problems: insufficient capacity and clamp-on terminals.  I believe -- without much evidence, I must admit -- that the clamps to the 2/0 wires are the source of a lot of heat, and it's killing batteries.  However, switching to higher-capacity batteries means rebuilding the battery boxes.  And switching to screw-on terminals means rebuilding all the wires.  And returning to 144V means buying a bunch of new regulators (I've blown up a bunch of mine).&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
If I'm going to go to that expense, I may as well go for some serious range.  I'm considering large AGMs, or even lithium.  I've run some numbers, and I've discovered that about 200Ah in a 144V battery pack will get me close to 100 miles.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
All I have to do is sell all my spare internal organs.  Or make it big with an iPhone app in a difficult economy.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Well, happy birthday anyway, Silent E.  I promise to get you back on the road as soon as I can afford it.&#13;
