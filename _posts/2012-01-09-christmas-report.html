Christmas was interesting as usual at my house.  I played Santa again, and that means I got to ride the fire truck! I ran out of candy a little early this year, but I think we made up for it at the "Sit on Santa's Knee" event.  
</p><p>
Luckily, that was <b>before</b> I caught the cold.  That laid me out for a week, even though I was treating it aggressively.  I probably caught it from Melissa; however, the doctor said she had a sinus infection, which shouldn't be contagious.

Eri got me a bicycle fender rack and saddlebags!  I can start riding to work <b>AND</b> bring a lunch!  That should help me get fit, along with tracking my intake on myFitnessPal.

I still haven't published my first app.  I'm sidetracked trying to make money on oDesk.  Thus far, I'm not impressed: it's a lot of work for <i>very</i> little reward.  Still, it's spending cash.
</p><p>
It wasn't enough to keep us out of the hole, though.  Christmas and Hanukkah used up all our cash, and now we're limping along, paycheck to paycheck.

Well, time to go wake the youngest.  It's her first day back at school after the break.  Here's hoping it's a good one!
