<p>Don't freak out, he's okay.
</p><p>
But yes, I did run over Neppy.  Or at least, I ran into him.
</p><p>
I was backing Silent E out of the garage.  I had just seen the cat, so I was moving slow and using a light throttle so the car made its Pedestrian Warning Noise.  He's so dumb he didn't even care!  Just as I'm figuring he must have moved, the whole car grinds to a halt and I hear this terrible "MRROWWRRR!".
</p><p>
I pulled forward quickly, seeing Neppy slink away in the rear-view mirror.  When I went to fetch the idiot, I found a big hunk of his hair in the driveway.

I told Eri, <i><b>discreetly</b></i>, and we watched him for a bit.  He was walking very cautiously, but apparently unhurt.  He went to tend to nature, and there was no blood, so I went to work.
</p><p>
That evening I picked him up.  He didn't complain, so I guess there are no broken ribs.
</p><p>
He may be dumb, but I'll bet he won't be doing that again anytime soon!
</p>
