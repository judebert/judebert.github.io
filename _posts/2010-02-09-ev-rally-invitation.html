<p>
A friend of mine, Clark, is really impressed with my EV.  He's been telling all his friends about it.
</p><p>
One of his friends runs <a href="http://www.rubelab.org/">RubeLab</a>, an environmental invention club.  When they put in their solar charging station, I really wanted to be there, but I couldn't make it: they're all the way in Eustis.
</p><p>
Apparently, they're having an EV rally on March 20th.  There will be a 15-mile scavenger hunt, with charging at the stops.  The director called me at home to ask if I could attend.
</p><p>
I accepted, of course!  Now I just need to get a hitch on my van so I can tow Silent E there!
