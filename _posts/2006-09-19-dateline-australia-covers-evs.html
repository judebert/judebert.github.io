  content: I downloaded it and played it.  Sound track was good all the way through,
    but most of the video was unrecongizable as anything other then video noise.

<p>A program in Australia called Dateline (no idea if it's related to the American program of the same name) just covered EVs.  I've got the video, clipped to include just the EV segment.  Be careful, though, it's huge: 135MB!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
You can <a href="/progress/media/EV/dateline_EVs_20060913.mp4" title="dateline_EVs_20060913.mp4" target="_blank">download the 135MB Australian Dateline EV segment here!</a>&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
<b>Update: 9/22</b><br />&#13;
I've just discovered that my favorite Windows DVD ripper, VLC, is available on Linux, too.  And it does a great job transcoding.  So, for those who had trouble downloading the MP4 file, you can get <a href="/progress/media/EV/dateline_EVs_20060913.mpg" title="dateline_EVs_20060913.mpg" target="_blank">the original-size Australian Dateline EV segment in MPG format (195MB)</a> or, for those with slower connections, <a href="/progress/media/EV/dateline_EVs_20060913_small.mpg" title="dateline_EVs_20060913_small.mpg" target="_blank">the half-size Australian Dateline EV segment in MPG format (89MB)</a>.&#13;
