  content: On the other hand, your vehicle is pretty quiet and you have a license
    plate labeled SILENT E.  I wouldn't be surprised if they figured it out.

  content: I dunno; across four lanes and a median from the other direction?  Doesn't
    seem like any of that would really apply.  I'm still going with "friend".

<p>I was driving  home with my middle daughter and a load of groceries; the windows were down, because I don't have air conditioning.  Luckily it was a very pleasant day.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
As I pulled away from a light, someone bellowed across four lanes and a median, "HIPPY!"&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
In a split second I considered my options.  I discarded the immediate outrage -- C'mon, people, there's a child in a car, must we resort to name calling? -- because I didn't want to turn it into a big problem.  Then I realized: I'm a pony-tailed peace-loving man driving an electric car; "hippy" is pretty accurate.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I put my hand out the window and raised a peace sign high.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It wasn't until I was past the intersection that I realized my car has no electric symbols on it anywhere.  Either I had just passed a friend with a sense of humor, or someone <b>really</b> wants me to cut my hair.&#13;
