<p>A guy at my office has a Saturn Sky.  It's really neat looking; I've always wanted to convert one.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Turns out <a href="http://www.evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=19855">AMP has already converted a Saturn Sky to all-electric</a>.  150 miles of range, too!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
They're applying for some of the $25 billion the government is offering the car companies to develop domestic, fuel-efficient cars.  Problem is, their car is already developed.  Still, they could provide jobs and spur domestic battery production besides.  I vote we give them some money.&#13;
