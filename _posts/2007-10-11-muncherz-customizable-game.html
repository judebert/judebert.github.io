<p>Kinda neat: a site with <a href="http://muncherz.com/games" title="Muncherz">a customizable game called "Muncherz"</a>.  It's a big grid, and you have to chomp some of the squares while monsters chase you around.  For instance, if you play "Even Numbers", you have to chomp only the even numbers.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I made <a href="http://muncherz.com/games/88">a spelling game: "Misspellings"</a>.  I used words from 1st through 7th grade spelling lists, finishing off with a grid of the most commonly misspelled American words.  &#13;

Go check it out!  If my game becomes the most popular, I get a $10 bonus!&#13;
