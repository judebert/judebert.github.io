Today Nathan and I banged and pried until we could get the armature out of the motor.  The adapter hub is still attached, unfortunately.  However, this lets us get a good look at the field coils.  And it should be cheaper to ship in two pieces, instead of one insanely heavy piece.&#13;
<p>&#13;
Of course, maybe we can get it shipped for free...&#13;

With a prybar, a giant screwdriver, and a hammer, getting the centrifugally-exploded wires bent upwards was no great task.  A little time-consuming, but no big deal.  And it let me get pictures of the field coils.&#13;

</figure>Looks like at least two of these will need rewinding.  Luckily, Jim Husted -- the guy who builds stuff for the electric drag racers -- has offered to do the job at a price that makes me feel like I'm taking advantage of him.  Everyone tells me that a motor rebuilt by Jim is better than new; I don't see how I can pass up this opportunity.&#13;
<p>&#13;
The interesting thing is shipping.  Probably better than $100, one-way.  So I'm investigating... alternatives.  Call it the Electric Express.  I can get the motor to Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, or Florida.  I'm trying to set up a chain going to Jim in Oregon.  I need people to carry it a little closer, each one willing to move it another step along the way.  I'll keep track of the possible chains here.  Everyone who participates will get a story to tell, and I'll even create a T-shirt design on Cafe Press for the event and pitch in $2 to $5 on the price for anyone who wants one.  (I can't have this getting more expensive than shipping it via DHL!)&#13;

And while we're talking about history...&#13;

The tax collector's office had wanted a serial number for my motor.  I couldn't find one.  Turns out that was because the clip was covering it.  Yes, the whole thing.  <b>My motor is serial number 4.</b>&#13;
<p>&#13;
Now, perhaps that's not its actual serial number.  Or perhaps they restarted every month, making this the 4th motor from August of 91.  (Sadly, I killed it just a week before its 15th birthday!)  But on the other hand, maybe this is the 4th one ever made.  Anyone care to comment?&#13;
