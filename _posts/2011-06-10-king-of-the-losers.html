That's right!  Today I made it to number 1 in the bronze league!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Yesterday I had a terrible, terrible day.  Today was the exact opposite.  I even beat off a Protoss who tried to proxy me <b>twice</b>. The adrenaline had me playing at platinum level.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The last opponent -- a Terran -- accused me of using "hacsk".  Since I don't, I'm taking that as a compliment.  &#13;

I'm King of the Losers!  Eat it, all you lesser losers!  ;)&#13;
