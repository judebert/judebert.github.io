	<h2>Introduction</h2>&#13;
	<p>&#13;
	Welcome to Judebert's How to Make a Mandelbrot.  This is a tutorial on how to make fractal&#13;
	images on your computer, including Mandelbrot sets.  I'll show you the math, include some&#13;
	source code fragments, and generally help you along.  I assume you already know a programming &#13;
	language like C, but I'll refresh you on the math as we go.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
	To understand fractals, you must understand complex numbers.  I've included a quick&#13;
	refresher course.  To avoid boring anyone, you can skip over the stuff you already know,&#13;
	straight to the stuff you're looking for:&#13;

<h2>Conventions</h2>&#13;
	I don't want to include a lot of graphics, so I've got to set up some conventions.&#13;
	<p>&#13;
	Multiplication will be represented by the asterisk: \*.  For instance, 3 \* 6 = 18.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
	When I want the square root of a number, I'll write sqrt(), like in C.  For instance, sqrt(4) = 2.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
	When I want the square of a number, I'll write **2.  For instance, 2**2 = 4.  I'll also use this &#13;
	for other exponents, like cubing: 2**3 = 8.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
	I'll write examples on their own lines, to make them easier to follow.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
	<a name="complex" id="complex"></a>&#13;
	</p>
<h2>Complex Numbers</h2>&#13;
	A complex number is a number including the square root of -1.  If you remember your algebra, you&#13;
	know that any number sqared is positive; therefore no known number squared can result in -1, since&#13;
	it is negative.  Since it doesn't exist, but we have to use it to solve some mathematical problems,&#13;
	we call it "imaginary."  We have to use sqrt(-1) often enough that we've given it a special symbol,&#13;
	based on the fact that it's imaginary: <i>i</i>.&#13;
	<p>&#13;
	Since <i>i</i> is an imaginary number, we couldn't just subtract it from other numbers.  What is &#13;
	2 - <i>i</i>?  Well, it's not 1.  It's not 3.  It's not any number we could actually &#13;
	name.  Therefore we just call it (2 - <i>i</i>).  Same thing goes for addition, multiplication, &#13;
	division, anything.  You might notice that (2 - <i>i</i>) has more two parts: the <i>real</i> part,&#13;
	which is 2, and the <i>imaginary</i> part, which is <i>i</i>.  Since this number contains more parts&#13;
	than a simple number, we call it a "complex" number.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
	Dealing with these numbers is not as difficult as it sounds.  Consider trying to add two complex &#13;
	numbers.  To complete this mind-bogglingly complex calculation, simply add the parts together.  &#13;
	Like this:</p>
<pre>&#13;
	(2 + <i>i</i>)&#13;
	+(1 + <i>i</i>)&#13;
	-- --------------&#13;
	(3 + 2<i>i</i>)&#13;
      </pre>&#13;
	That's all.  This example gives you an glimpse at multiplication, too:  just like for any other&#13;
	number, 2<i>i</i> is the same as <i>i</i> + <i>i</i>.  &#13;
	<p>&#13;
	Note that you can add complex and simple numbers, too.  This is easy because you can think of a &#13;
	simple number as a complex number with the <i>i</i> set to 0.  For instance, 5 can be thought of as&#13;
	(5 + 0<i>i</i>).  So to add (2 + <i>i</i>) and 5, you could do this:</p>
<pre>&#13;
	(2 +  <i>i</i>)&#13;
	+(5 + 0<i>i</i>)&#13;
	----------------&#13;
	(7 +  <i>i</i>)&#13;
      </pre>&#13;
	<p>&#13;
	Here's another example:</p>
<pre>&#13;
	(2 + <i>i</i>)&#13;
	+(1 - <i>i</i>)&#13;
	---------------&#13;
	(3 + 0<i>i</i>), which is 3. &#13;
      </pre>&#13;
	Got it?  Good.  The same thing works for subtraction.&#13;
	<p>&#13;
	Now for multiplication.  As you recall from above, <i>i</i> is sqrt(-1); therefore <i>i</i>**2, or &#13;
	<i>i</i> squared, is -1.  This is simple, so I'll only say it one more time:  since sqrt(x)**2 (the&#13;
	square root of x, squared) is x, <i>i</i>**2 is sqrt(-1)**2, which is -1.  Thus ends the lesson in&#13;
	definitions and identities.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
	The tricky part is multiplying complex numbers.  For instance, what is </p>
<pre>&#13;
	(2 + <i>i</i>) \* (1 + 2<i>i</i>)?&#13;
			</pre>&#13;
	Well, the thing to do here is to remember your algebra.  This is the same thing as <pre>&#13;
	(2 + x) \* (1 + 2x)&#13;
      </pre>&#13;
  which you can multiply with the FOIL method.  Certainly you remember FOIL.  FOIL stands for First, &#13;
  Outer, Inner, Last -- the way you multiply polynomials.  In this case: <pre>&#13;
	(2 + x) \* (1 + 2x)&#13;
	The First terms are 2 and 1.             2 \* 1  =  2.&#13;
	The Outer terms are 2 (again) and 2x.    2 \* 2x = 4x.  &#13;
	The Inner terms are x and 1.             x \* 1  =  x.&#13;
	The Last  terms are x and 2x.            x \* 2x = 2x**2.&#13;
			</pre>&#13;
  So we wind up with 2 + 4x + x + 2x**2, which when added together make 2 + 5x + 2x**2.  Curses,&#13;
  FOILed again!  :)&#13;
	<p>&#13;
  Well, the original question was about multiplying two complex numbers; so we substitute <i>i</i>&#13;
  for the x and get 2 + 5<i>i</i> + 2<i>i</i>**2.  And, as you recall from the start of the&#13;
  discussion, <i>i</i>**2 is -1, so the 2<i>i</i>**2 is best written as -2.  That changes the &#13;
  polynomial a bit, to 2 + 5<i>i</i> + (-2), which is 0 + 5<i>i</i>, or just 5<i>i</i>, if you like.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  If you got lost, go back and read it again.  This is important to the whole idea of fractals.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  <a name="squarei" id="squarei"></a>&#13;
  One last note before moving on:  there's a simpler way to see the outcome when you square a&#13;
  polynomial.  Here it is, using no numbers, all letters:</p>
<pre>&#13;
	(a + bx) \* (a + bx)&#13;
	The First terms are a and a.             a \* a  = a**2&#13;
	The Outer terms are a (again) and bx.    a \* bx = abx.&#13;
	The Inner terms are bx and a.            bx \* a = abx.&#13;
	The Last  terms are bx and bx.           bx \* bx = (b**2)(x**2)&#13;
      </pre>&#13;
  So we wind up with a**2 + 2abx + (b**2)(x**2).  With complex numbers, that x is actually <i>i</i>, so &#13;
  (x**2) is going to be (<i>i</i>**2), which is -1 (as you recall), so we <em>actually</em> wind up with&#13;
  a**2 + 2ab<i>i</i> - b**2.  It's best to write this with the real numbers on the left, and the &#13;
  imaginary numbers on the right, just like a complex number.  The final formula is:&#13;
	<p>&#13;
  (a + b<i>i</i>)**2 = a**2 - b**2 + 2ab<i>i</i>.&#13;
	</p>&#13;
&#13;
	<a name="plane" id="plane"></a>&#13;
  <h2>The Complex Plane</h2>&#13;
  The Mandelbrot uses a complex plane; all fractals do.  &#13;
  <img width="100" height="100" src="/progress/media/axis.gif" alt="A Number Plane" align="right" />   &#13;
  You're accustomed to a number plane with x going left-to-right (horizontal) and y going up-and-down &#13;
  (vertical).  (At least, I HOPE you're familiar with this idea.)&#13;
  The complex plane is a very simple modification on this standard number plane, with the vertical &#13;
  axis being imaginary numbers. That's right, &#13;
  instead of ...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2... the vertical axis is ...-2<i>i</i>, -1<i>i</i>, 0<i>i</i>, 1<i>i</i>, 2<i>i</i>...&#13;
  <p>&#13;
  That makes it easy to place complex numbers on the plane.  For instance, (2 - <i>i</i>) could be&#13;
  drawn as a point at (2, -1).  (-2 + 3<i>i</i>) could be drawn as a point at (-2, 3).  This is going&#13;
  to come in handy in just a moment.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  <img width="100" height="100" src="/progress/media/magnitude.gif" alt="Magnitude of a Complex Number" align="right" />&#13;
  Finally, the last idea about complex numbers and the complex plane you need to know: <b>magnitude</b>.&#13;
  This is just the distance from the origin of the complex plane to the point.  You use the &#13;
  pythagorean theorem for this one: a**2 + b**2 = c**2.  So, the complex number (3 + 4<i>i</i>),&#13;
  which lies at (3, 4) on the complex plane, has a magnitude of: </p>
<pre>&#13;
&#13;
	3**2 + 4**2 = magnitude**2&#13;
	9 + 16 = magnitude**2&#13;
	25 = magnitude**2&#13;
	5 = magnitude&#13;
  </pre> for a magnitude of 5.  &#13;
  &#13;
&#13;
  <a name="formula" id="formula"></a>&#13;
  <h2>The Mandelbrot</h2>&#13;
  You might notice that all those complex numbers have some interesting properties.  For instance,&#13;
  Benoit Mandelbrot noticed that if you square the number, then add it on to your figure, and kept&#13;
  doing that forever, the number will either become infinitely large or it will tend to go towards&#13;
  0.  The formula looks like this:<pre>&#13;
	z = z**2 + c&#13;
	or more computerish&#13;
	z = last_z**2 + c.&#13;
      </pre>&#13;
  Consider (2, 0) for example.  We start z and last_z at 0, and set c to (2 + 0<i>i</i>).  Then:<pre>&#13;
	0: last_z**2 + c = &#13;
	0**2 + (2 + 0<i>i</i>), which is &#13;
	(2 + 0<i>i</i>).  &#13;
	</pre>So now we set last_z to (2 + 0<i>i</i>) and try again.  I'll use the <a href="#squarei">simple &#13;
      formula for squaring complex numbers</a> that we developed above:<pre>&#13;
&#13;
	1: last_z**2 + c =&#13;
	(2 + 0<i>i</i>)**2 + c = &#13;
	(4 - 0 + 0<i>i</i>) + c = &#13;
	(4 + 0<i>i</i>) + (2 + 0<i>i</i>) = &#13;
	(6 + 0<i>i</i>). &#13;
      </pre> So now we set last_z to 6 and try again.  &#13;
	It's easy to see that this is going to get really big really fast, so let's just leave it here and&#13;
	say that it's going to become infinitely large.&#13;
	<p>&#13;
	That was the easy example.  For a harder one, consider (0, -1).  We start z and last z at&#13;
	0, then set c to (0 - <i>i</i>).  Then: </p>
<pre>&#13;
&#13;
	0: last_z**2 + c =&#13;
	0**2 + (0 - <i>i</i>) = &#13;
	(0 - <i>i</i>).&#13;
      </pre>In the future, you advanced mathematicians can just start with last_z = c, since that's &#13;
	the way it's always going to work out.  Next step! Set last_z to (0 - <i>i</i>) and do it again: <pre>&#13;
	1: last_z**2 + c = &#13;
	(0 - <i>i</i>)**2 + c =&#13;
	(0 - 1 + 0<i>i</i>) + c =&#13;
	(-1 + 0<i>i</i>) + c =&#13;
	(-1 + 0<i>i</i>) + (0 - <i>i</i>) =&#13;
	(-1 - <i>i</i>)&#13;
	</pre>So far so good.  Let's try another iteration.  Set last_z to (-1 - <i>i</i>) and: <pre>&#13;
&#13;
	2: last_z**2 + c =&#13;
	(-1 - <i>i</i>)**2 + c =&#13;
	(1 - 1 + 2<i>i</i>) + c = &#13;
	(0 + 2<i>i</i>) + c = &#13;
	(0 + 2<i>i</i>) + (0 - <i>i</i>) =&#13;
	(0 + <i>i</i>)&#13;
      </pre>Still no guess.  We can't tell what's going to happen yet.  I'll skip the math examples and&#13;
	just let you know what the next few iterations will give us:<pre>&#13;
	3: (-1 - <i>i</i>)&#13;
	4: ( 0 + <i>i</i>)&#13;
	5: (-1 - <i>i</i>)&#13;
	6: ( 0 + <i>i</i>)&#13;
	7: (-1 - <i>i</i>)&#13;
      </pre> Anyone see a pattern developing?  This is going to keep up all day.  As we iterate infinite&#13;
  times, this number goes towards 0.&#13;
	<p>&#13;
  Obviously it's nice to have a computer to do all this figuring for us.  I'll leave the programming&#13;
  to you; come up with a nice representation of complex numbers and use it.  Or get a fractal program&#13;
  that already does this stuff for you.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  For these examples, we could tell intuitively whether they would become infinitely large.  But&#13;
  the computer will need some rules.  How can the computer tell if we're going infinite?&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  Some lucky mathematician already solved this problem for us.  He proved that if the magnitude of&#13;
  a complex number was greater than 2, then it would go to infinity when used in Mandelbrot's &#13;
  formula.  So if we ever get a number of magnitude greater than 2, we're done with that point.  And&#13;
  it's easy to see that (-23, -8) has a magnitude much greater than 2, so it will go to infinity, &#13;
  just as we suspected.  (Another note for the advanced mathematicians:  why bother to take the&#13;
  square root?  You get the square of the magnitude along the way; just check to see if its greater&#13;
  than 4.)&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  <img width="133" height="100" src="/progress/media/mand1.gif" alt="black and white Mandelbrot example" align="left" />&#13;
  This is where the pretty picture comes in.  We can see the Mandelbrot set will never go farther up,&#13;
  down, left or right than 2, since (0, 2), (2, 0), (-2, 0), and (0, -2) all have magnitude greater&#13;
  than 2.  So we start at (-2, 2) and work pixel-by-pixel towards&#13;
  (2, -2).  If the number goes to infinity (magnitude &gt; 2) we draw a point there and move on.  If it&#13;
  doesn't, we draw a black point (or don't draw the point at all) and move on.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  Wait... what about the ones that don't go to infinity?&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  Their magnitude never goes over 2, so if we only check for numbers getting too big &#13;
  we'll be stuck working complex&#13;
  multiplication all day.  Computers are fast, but an endless loop is still an endless loop.  You'll&#13;
  never get to infinity, no matter how fast you run.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  So we'd better limit how long we're willing to work this problem.  If after, say, 100 calculations&#13;
  your number <i>still</i> hasn't reached a magnitude of 2, we'll guess that it's on its way to 0 and&#13;
  draw it black.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  This also gives us a nice way to add color to our picture.  &#13;
  <img width="200" height="150" src="/progress/media/mand2.gif" alt="color Mandelbrot example" align="right" />&#13;
  Some numbers start on their way to &#13;
  infinity faster than others.  (2, 2) does it right off.  If we look at how many times we had to &#13;
  calculate before we stop, we could color pixels according to how fast the number "escapes."  The&#13;
  faster pixels could be closer to white (or blue, or whatever) while the slower ones get darker and&#13;
  darker.  (Actually it looks better the other way, with faster pixels dark and slower pixels bright,&#13;
  but who cares?  Color it however you like it.)  The pixels that never escape we color black.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  That gives you the classic Mandelbrot, right there on your screen.  Cool, huh?&#13;
	</p>&#13;
&#13;
  <a name="other" id="other"></a>&#13;
  <h2>Anything else?</h2>&#13;
  There are a few things you should be careful about if you intend to take this any farther.&#13;
	<p>&#13;
  We've been working with integers; the Mandelbrot set we draw works with real numbers.  Like&#13;
  (1.5768293 + 0.2836589<i>i</i>).  Computers are great, aren't they?  If you're drawing from (-2, 2)&#13;
  to (2, -2), then your number plane is 4.0 across.  If you've got 640 pixels accross the screen,&#13;
  then you want to start at -2.0 and add (4.0 / 640) = 0.00625 each time until you get to 2.  Get the&#13;
  idea?  That's how all these examples were drawn.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  Why just draw from (-2, 2) to (2, -2)?  That shows you the whole set.  It's pretty, but... there&#13;
  are more interesting things farther down.  Try drawing from (-0.5, 2) to (0.5, 1.0).  Or other&#13;
  places.  Just be careful: some of those places that look black aren't really black.  They're pixels&#13;
	that would have gone to infinity if we waited longer (they're escaping <em>really</em> slowly).  &#13;
	Try 150, 1000, 1500, 10000 iterations.  It'll&#13;
  take longer, but you'll get to see more of the Mandelbrot set, and in better detail, too.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  If you try more iterations than you have colors, you could run into trouble.  For instance, if you&#13;
  have a table of 256 colors, and you find a pixel that escapes after 300 iterations, what color do&#13;
  you paint it?  Maybe you should try to map the iterations into a colormap differently.  You could&#13;
  spread the iterations through the color bands.  Or find a way to map into 24 bit color.&#13;
	</p>
<p>&#13;
  While we're on the subject, why use the iterations to color the pixels?  I only mentioned it because&#13;
  it's simple and easy.  You could use the magnitude of the pixel when it escaped as its color.  Or you &#13;
  could use the iteration as the red component, the magnitude as the blue component, and the start &#13;
  number as the green.  What the hell; it can't be worse than some of the stuff I've tried.&#13;

  <b>Julia sets</b>.  A Julia set has the same formula as the Mandelbrot set.  The only difference is&#13;
  that the Julia set uses a constant value for <i>c</i>.  In a Mandelbrot, you change the <i>c</i> in&#13;
  "z = last_z**2 + c" every time you calculate a new pixel.  In a Julia, you change <i>c</i> only at&#13;
  the beginning of a render.  The last_z starts not at 0, but at the value of the point you're &#13;
  calculating right now.  This picture is a Julia set where <i>c</i> is a point near the tip of the&#13;
  Mandelbrot set.  Julias and Mandelbrots have a lot in common.  Click the picture to get a larger&#13;
