<a href="http://s9y.org">Serendipity</a> is getting used in big things.  It's the blog I donate time and effort to; it's extremely flexible and well supported.  Well, looks like there's an SEO contest going on, and the #2 spot is using Serendipity.  You can check out her site at <a href="http://ambatch-dotcom-seocontest.com">ambatchdotcom seocontest</a> and see how Serendipity is powering the important stuff!</p>
