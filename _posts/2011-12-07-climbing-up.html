Yesterday my wife took <a href="/progress/archives/417-Rock-Bottom.html">the bike</a> to a nearby bike shop and fixed the flat.  Since the wheels were dry-rotted, she also got a new tire... but only for the flat back wheel.
</p><p>
Everything else was really expensive, so no rack, no saddlebags, and no bike carrier for the car.  I'm stuck with my laptop bag until further notice.
</p><p>
<b>BUT!</b>  Today I got to work in under 30 minutes, with no significant pain.  And then I did it again on the way home!
</p><p>
I'm starting to think a decent bike might be a good investment.  It is Christmas time; maybe Goodwill or a pawn shop will have something.  Then again, maybe I should leave that for some kid who wants it more.
</p><p>
Biking again tomorrow.  We'll see how it goes!
