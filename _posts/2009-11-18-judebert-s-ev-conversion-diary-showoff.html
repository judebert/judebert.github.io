I'm glad I've painted the car; otherwise I wouldn't have had much to show off the past couple of days!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Last Thursday I went to Hagerty High School and gave a presentation about EVs in general -- and mine in particular -- to their National Honor Society club.  (Here's my <a href="/progress/media/EV/Not_Dead_Yet.odp" title="Not_Dead_Yet.odp" target="_blank">EV presentation slides with notes in OpenOffice format</a> (CreepyGirl font required for title page), and my <a href="/progress/media/EV/Not_Dead_Yet.pdf" title="Not_Dead_Yet.pdf" target="_blank">EV presentation in PDF format</a>, which doesn't support notes, but gets the cover right.) I estimate 100 or more students in attendance.  The A/V club filmed it.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Yesterday I presented the car to the 3rd grade classes at Carillon Elementary.  I didn't have a computer to present with, so I brought lots of EV parts, including my two dead batteries.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
The high school presentation was nerve-wracking.  I worked for a week on the slides, only to realize that they stank.  I had created a bunch of bulleted lists!  My expected dialogue was in the notes, but I don't really think any dialogue can rescue a presentation that boring.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I spent all my free time one day replacing the dialogue with the bullets, and the bullets with pictures.  I discovered the hell that is searching for free reusable images.  I pulled it through somehow.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I was a little nervous while presenting.  I stumbled and stuttered a few times.  Certainly I was not the best presenter they had ever seen.  I was a little thrown by the students themselves: about half of them were sleeping!  About a quarter were paying attention, a quarter were spacing out (I didn't make my presentation interesting enough), and a few were laughing at me.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Afterwards I showed them Silent E herself.  They had some fantastic questions, although they were very concerned about the Curtis whine.  There was one student who asked, "Wait... there's no gas in here anywhere?"  Obviously my 30-minute presentation needs some work.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Then I gave the teacher a ride.  I floored it, and although the tires didn't squeal, the teacher exclaimed, "It feels like I'm lifting off!  And it's so quiet!"&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The elementary school was a little more grueling.  I was outside and standing the whole time, and I didn't really have much chance to prepare visual aids.  Without a presentation to keep their attention, I decided I needed to hand out manipulatives.  I brought my two dead batteries so they could see how heavy they were; the parts from the old adapter; a few cast-offs from the mounts I had built; two of the the electronic boards that keep my batteries from overcharging; some wire, some fuses, and two potentiometers.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I figured out a good introduction, and winged it from there.  I tried to involve the students by asking questions.  I wound up talking to eight classes during a two-hour period, in two groups of three and one group of two.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The kids seemed to tolerate the presentation, but they enjoyed actually looking at the car.  They also loved trying to lift the batteries.  They asked plenty of questions, so I guess they were engaged.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But the thing they liked best was watching the teachers go for rides.  I tried to give every teacher a shot, although we didn't have time for everyone.  They would yell to decide which teacher went first, and cheer when we came back around the bus loop.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The teachers were reasonably impressed, and the ride gave them a chance to ask their own questions.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I loved presenting.  I hope I get the chance to do it again, soon!&#13;
