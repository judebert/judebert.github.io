<p>So, I've been slacking off on getting the EV put back together.  Now my commuter car has broken down.  The water pump is broken, and it'll cost $450 to fix it.
</p><p>
Worse yet, I stranded the guy I was carpooling with, and inconvenienced a coworker who had to come get us.
</p><p>
The car is really in rough shape.  One of the tie-rod ends is so bad that the car wobbles all the way to 60 MPH.  One of the front tires is bald.  It leaks in the rain.  The paint, upholstery, and vinyl are shot.
</p><p>
Maybe it's time to let this one go.  Perhaps the public radio station would like it as a donation.
