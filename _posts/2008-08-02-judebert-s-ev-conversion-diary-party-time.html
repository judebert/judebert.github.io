<p>In the latest round of daily range extension (good grief, that sounds like spam!) I took my wife and youngest daughter to a friend's party.  The longest single contiguous trip we've taken: 8 miles.  And with a heavier load than usual.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Near the end, she wasn't accelerating so well.  But we got there without damaging anything.  We charged for about 4 hours at the party, then drove home.  I took a different, slightly faster route, and we seemed to do fine.  People who passed me seemed to look over more than usual, and I think someone even waved (I was too busy watching the road).&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Except for the stop light where I couldn't get into gear, and some ... driver honked at me.  I was sitting there thinking, "Yeah, make your own electric car and see how well it does!"&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
Once I came back, I took some more pictures for the <a href="http://hondacivicwagon.com/">Honda Civic Wagon forum</a>.  I posted a bunch of pictures earlier, but they were all the outside of the car.  I forgot to provide anything interesting!  Here are the photos I snapped:&#13;

</figure>&#13;
<p>Here you see the engine bay.  The major components are the controller (the long black rectangle on the left), the motor (barely-visible blue thing), and the DC/DC Converter (silver box on the right).  The converter acts like an alternator, converting the 120V from the battery to 12V for the lights, wipers, and other accessories.&#13;

  <figcaption>Dashboard<br /><a href="/progress/media/EV/photos/silent-e-dash-big.jpg">Big</a></figcaption>
</figure>&#13;
<p>Here's a picture of the dash.  You can see it looks almost completely normal, with the exception of that big round gauge on the left.  That's an E-Meter, which was recently renamed a "Link-10".  It provides a bar estimating how full my pack is, along with several other measurements I can cycle through, like pack voltage and kWh used.  I usually leave it measuring amps, so I can tell how much energy I'm using up <i>right now</i>.  I expect it will help me adjust my driving habits.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The only other difference between this dash and others is that the gas gauge always reads Empty.  And the temperature gauge always reads cold.&#13;

<p>The rear battery pack currently holds 6 batteries, plus a plywood frame to fill out the space where the other two batteries went.  That's hidden farther back, under the floor metal, so you can't see it.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The rear seats fold up and down just like usual.  It's sort of a stealth EV.  As you can see in the first photo, I was just using them with a child's booster seat to get to the party.  Observant readers (and parents) will notice the optional child-debris package.  ;)&#13;

<p>This is a PFC-20 charger.  It can handle normal wall voltage, including 120V and 240V, and output anything from 12V up to.. heck, I don't even know; at least 240V.  At up to 20 amps.  I usually charge around 10A, but from the 20A plug at work I'll pull 15A.&#13;

<p>And the coup de grace: the fuel door.  This is all I need to do to recharge.  No muss, no fuss, no fumes, no problem.  Refueling stations everywhere I go.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
There's a little sticker that says "120V 60Hz Only", but it's nowhere near as visible as the unleaded fuel sticker.  I gotta replace that.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
And that's the end of our tour!  Hope you enjoyed this look at real, working electric vehicle!&#13;
