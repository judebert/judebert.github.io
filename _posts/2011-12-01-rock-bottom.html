  content: " Yesterday my wife took the bike to a nearby bike shop and fixed the flat.
    Since the wheels were dry-rotted, she also got a new tire... but only for the
    flat back wheel. Everything else was really expensive, so no rack, no saddlebags,
    and no bike car"

Remember how I said <a href="/progress/archives/416-Back-on-the-Bike.html">I'm climbing down the vehicle prestige ladder</a>?  Well, I think I've just hit the bottom.  My bike got a flat.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Of course, I have no repair kit.  This bike is more than 20 years old; the steel wheels are RUSTING.  I have no desire to spend money on fancy bits like an attached repair kit.  On that note, it has neither rack nor saddlebags; I have to carry my change of clothes in a laptop bag, and it only barely fits.  There's no space for a repair kit.&#13;

I have no idea how I'm going to get to work the next time my daughter needs the car.  What's below "beat-up pink female bicycle" on the vehicle prestige ladder?  Roller skates?&#13;

Unicycle?&#13;
