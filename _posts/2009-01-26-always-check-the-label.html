<p>Last night the kids went to bed early, so Eri and I figured we had a chance to watch a movie.  We picked "Consenting Adults" from our Roku playlist.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Now, usually we enjoy romantic comedy/drama or science fiction, with the occasional action, fantasy, or kids movie.  But these movies are often spoiled by their descriptions, so we skip over them.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It turned out to be a psychological thriller, starring Kevin Kline.  Perhaps that's how it got on the queue in the first place: we're accustomed to seeing him do outstanding work in comedies.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We were both traumatized by the end.  We watched an episode of "Coupling" to make up for it.  Wow, that show is fantastic.&#13;
