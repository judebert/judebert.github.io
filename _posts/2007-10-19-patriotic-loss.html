  content: We just a photo of got one of the old Uncle Sam posters from Google Images,
    then used the Gimp to paste her face on.  Pretty simple stuff, really.

<p>My daughter, Melissa, wanted to run for student council, and I agreed to help with her posters.  So I put her face on the <a target="_blank" href="/progress/media/gimpwork/Uncle_Sam_poster.jpg">Uncle Sam from the classic recruitment poster</a>.  Then we blew it up with the printer's "3x3" setting (which smoothed some of those nasty edges) and pasted it on posterboard with "I want YOU to VOTE FOR MELISSA!" in giant letters.  It was eerily fantastic!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
She lost.  There were only three candidates, and they needed two representatives.  They chose both of the other kids, but not Melissa.  How in the world did we lose?  &#13;

I'll never understand 4th graders.&#13;
