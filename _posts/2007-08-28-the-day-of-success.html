Yesterday started off terribly: my youngest didn't want to go to school, and wouldn't get out of the car when we got there; my car smelled bad from getting rained on with the windows open; my eldest had an infection.

But everything turned around by the end of the day.  The youngest loved her day at school.  The car was still wet, but it was drying out.  The eldest had her antibiotics.

Better yet, after three weeks of effort, my code finally worked.  I also found an empty partition on my hard drive at work and fixed a persistent, annoying space problem.  That seemed to speed up the whole computer.  And then, with the help of the EVDL, <a href="/progress/EV/Motor-Moves-Again.html">I fixed my EV</a>.

I'm ready to declare a family holiday:  August 27th, the Day of Success.
