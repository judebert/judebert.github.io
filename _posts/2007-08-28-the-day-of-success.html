Yesterday started off terribly: my youngest didn't want to go to school, and wouldn't get out of the car when we got there; my car smelled bad from getting rained on with the windows open; my eldest had an infection.&#13;

Better yet, after three weeks of effort, my code finally worked.  I also found an empty partition on my hard drive at work and fixed a persistent, annoying space problem.  That seemed to speed up the whole computer.  And then, with the help of the EVDL, <a href="/progress/EV/Motor-Moves-Again.html">I fixed my EV</a>.&#13;

I'm ready to declare a family holiday:  August 27th, the Day of Success.&#13;
