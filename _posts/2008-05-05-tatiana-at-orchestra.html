Yesterday Nathan was supposed to come over and work on the car with me.  However, Tatiana was performing as part of the <a href="http://www.fyao.org/">Florida Young Artists Orchestra</a>, so we canceled the garage work and I spent the day with my family.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Okay, I spent the day driving my family around.  Specifically, Omi and Opi.  Opi seems to be adjusting to travel, at least a little bit.&#13;

It was a wonderful evening.  A <a href="http://www.thebrazeneye.com/index.html">fantastic picture</a> sold at auction for a good price, despite its value being underestimated by half.  (Much thanks to Melynda for the work she did preparing the painting.)  Tatiana did a fantastic job!  The orchestra was fantastic, and the newly commissioned Ponce De Leon Suite gave me shivers.  Melissa played the cowbell for Tangerine Rag, and it was terrific, too!  &#13;

I heartily recommend any of the FYAO events.  They're always interesting, and the world needs more music.&#13;
