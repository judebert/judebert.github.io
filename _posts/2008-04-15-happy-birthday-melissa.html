<p>&#13;
My middle daughter turned 10 today!  We started the day with a mini-party: the living room was all decorated and her presents were waiting for her.  She loved her Play-Doh Littlest Pet Shop from Kayla, her latch hook project from Tatiana, and her Erector set from us.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Eri brought her whole class donuts at snack time.  Then Tatiana called me from school: she was sick.  I took off the rest of the day to take care of her.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Everything was much better by the time Eri got home.  I made lasagna while Melissa was at gymnastics class; when she got home, we had her favorite meal, finished with cheesecake with perpetual candles.  We watched <i>I Dream of Jeannie</i> while we ate.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
She said it was a fantastic day.  Happy Birthday, Melissa!&#13;
