<h3>The Conversion</h3>
<p>My brother, Nathan, and I have always been fascinated by EVs (Electric Vehicles).  He's hooked on hybrids, while I've always liked straight battery power.  He's a mechanic, I'm a computer scientist with a mathematical bent.  It all started coming together when my 1990 Geo Prizm Hatchback started to act like it would make a good conversion car: the engine      was starting to burn oil, the power steering started to leak, and the rack needed to be replaced.  I fixed a leak that was flooding my trunk every time it rained,  and we were ready to go.
</p><p>
Then I got rear-ended.  The place that fixed the car did a poor job, so the leak came back.  After that, I wouldn't trust the frame.  And Nathan decided to move to Reno, NV.
</p><p>
Were we deterred?  Hell, no.  Over the (sensible) objections of our wife and girlfriend, we decided to make a go of it anyway, with Nathan doing all the hard work in Reno and me supervising from Orlando.  Then he could come visit for some occasion, and tow the EV along.
</p><p>
This is the story of our "long-distance" conversion.
