  content: "I share your desire for a good UML tool.  This is what I have encountered
    to date:\r\n\r\nStar UML - more bugs than you can shake a stick at, doesn't import
    existing code very well. Still probably the best open source option that I have
    encountered.\r\n\r\nArgo UML - last time I used this (4 years ago), it seemed
    to be lacking some basic diagramming features but it might be worth a second look
    since it is another open source freebie.  It seems to continue to be actively
    developed.\r\n\r\nRational Rose - the most bloated UML tool of all the UML tools.
    \ Does just about everything, but has a steep learning curve and very expensive.\r\n\r\nEnterprise
    Architect - this is the hands down winner in my book.  After playing with it for
    just a short time, the work flow becomes second nature.  It works as you would
    expect a UML tool to work without all the bloat and bugs of some of the others.
    \ Also handles massive imports of existing projects.  It successfully imported
    the huge SAF java application that I use at work, without failing.  If I could
    only convince management that it is worth the $200 license cost."

  content: "I too am looking for the best UML modeling tool that I can get (for my
    virtual zero money).  In August of 07 I started teaching myself xhtml, php, and
    javascript.  I then added in actionscript 3.  I started a moderate project for
    a friend... it escalated into a massive project in three formats.  With a few
    thousand hours, I got most everything working (although they three versions are
    not perfectly symmetric).  Everything isn't complete, but... I've been studying
    the whole time and knew that the way things were panning out, that it was going
    to come back to \"byte me in the .as\" ;-) eventually.  Every month or so my friend
    was like \"and blogs... and videos... and you get the idea.\" The long and the
    short is that I was making it all up as I went along.  Luckily since I started
    with the Flex version, teaching myself as3 helped me to notice \"best practice\"
    types of things.\r\n\r\nI decided a few weeks ago that rather than continue trying
    to finish \"v1\" in its rag tag by-the-seat-of-the-pants fashion; I was going
    to stop and really start to employ the design patterns and practices I've been
    studying and jump-start v2 while still making additions to the original.\r\n\r\nSo,
    I spent about a week looking at freebie CASE tools.  I'm very picky about what
    I install on my computers (for performance reasons) and after lots of reading
    I downloaded and installed StarUML, ArgoUML, & Umbrello.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to
    figure out which one I should get myself engrossed in.  This project is going
    to be considerably large (I don't know how large, *large* is in software terms,
    but I know that last I knew I have roughly 2000 files that compose or support
    the project).  So, I don't want to make massively detailed diagrams that I would
    then have to re-create if for some reason I decide that I need to use a different
    one.  I like ArgoUML's critics except when it advises me about things that *can't*
    change, I also like the comments that it adds to the stub code.  I like StarUML's
    interface, it seems pretty cool to me.  I haven't been able to export my dummy
    project and then import it in Umbrello or ArgoUML.  I haven't really messed with
    Umbrello for that reason, but it does appear to have potential.\r\n\r\nIn general
    I'm looking for something that's usable, can generate AS3 & PHP so that I have
    identical packages, interfaces, & classes that power the different user venues
    (full DXHTML, Mobile XHTML, and Adobe Flex).  Umbrello lists Actionscript & PHP5
    in its language list, so does ArgoUML, & StarUML has export templates for both.
    \ I stopped working in ArgoUML because their help tutorial has \"to be written...\"
    as the content in the main sections describing how to develop an application using
    the program...\r\n\r\nI got \"Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design\" yesterday
    and I'm 185 pages into it now.  My thought is to \"Abstract the process from the
    program\" so that I can effectively do what I need to regardless of interface
    (aside from mirroring classes in AS3 & PHP [JSON would be useful too!])\r\n\r\nSorry
    I ramble... I really just wanted to post so that I could subscribe and follow
    any updates 8)"

    is because I intend to teach myself Java (which doesn't seem like too much of
    a stretch from AS3).  After/when I do, I want to convert the entire project into
    Java so that it's lighter & faster (maybe/hopefully 8).

  content: "I have since \"broken down\" and downloaded Visual-Paradigm (http://www.visual-paradigm.com/).
    \ I had seen it mentioned in the Google ads while I was looking around.  It said
    \"free,\" but when I went to look, it didn't look like there was anything free
    about it-- I detest being misled.  However, after some deliberation after writing
    the above, I thought, perhaps it's best if I investigate something that might
    be worth a bit of money if I *do* get myself embedded in it.\r\n\r\nIt turns out
    that, English isn't their best language, so some of their wording threw me off
    (especially not knowing that English wasn't native to them).\r\n\r\nThe 30 day
    trial is your typical \"30-day bells-and-whistles\" deal, that then switches over
    to the the less enabled free version.  You can activate the free key/free version
    immediately or use the 30 day enterprise trial first, that's what I'm currently
    doing.\r\n\r\nI have done a reasonable amount of playing with it & watched most
    of their online video tutorials (they have lots, maybe 75+).\r\n\r\nSo far, I
    love it.  I'm not sure what I'll loose after the 30 days, but I'm also pretty
    sure that I probably haven't even used any of that functionality (yet).\r\n\r\nIt's
    awesome, I definitely want this program.  It has built in textual analysis that
    will allow you to 'click-and-convert' text to model elements, synchronize various
    things, and lots of other things like animation, entire sub-diagrams accessible
    within nodes in other diagrams (of any other type), & more, & more.\r\n\r\nI just
    looked at the page to find some things & apparently since I downloaded it a few
    days ago they're released \"Visual Paradigm for UML 7\" (I got v6.4) and \"Visual
    Paradigm Suite 4.0\" (I got v3.4).\r\n\r\nThere is so much stuff built in.  If
    it wasn't for the fact that everything that I build -- is more-or-less for fun
    & for free.  I would love to buy this so that I can play with everything. (Like
    I said I taught myself, because I didn't have anything else to do, am curious,
    like logic, & like puzzles [useful puzzles!  jigsaws, etc. not worth devoting
    time to])\r\n\r\nIf you haven't looked into it, check it out.  Maybe there's just
    something about it that appeals to the way that I think (combined with the fact
    that I'm teaching myself the UML etc. at the same time).  Just thought I'd share.\r\n\r\nHere's
    the link to their demos for all who are interested:\r\nhttp://www.visual-paradigm.com/product/vpuml/demos/\r\n\r\nNamaste!\r\nChaos7703

<p>&#13;
In my job, I go through a Software Design phase for every task I'm given.  That includes drawing a class diagram and a sequence diagram in more-or-less standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML</a>.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Now, I've drawn my diagrams in a variety of tools in the past, ranging from the highly specialized to the wildly simplistic (like PowerPoint).  I've come to understand the shortcomings of UML modeling tools in general.  And as a good geek, I'm going to write them down.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Rather than being negative, I'm going to write down what I want from a modeling tool.  Then I can use that wishlist as criteria for evaluating the available tools, until I find a good one.  If any such thing exists.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
The following are absolutely required for any UML modeling tool:&#13;
</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li>Supports Class and Sequence Diagrams<br />&#13;
More would be nice, but these are the two I really require.</li>&#13;
<li>Configurable Display<br />&#13;
I should be allowed to choose whether parameters are included in the messages on sequence diagrams.  I should also be able to choose not to display some operations of a class in a class diagram, since they're probably not all important to my design.</li>&#13;
<li>Group Selection and Movement<br />&#13;
This is particularly important on sequence diagrams, where I move groups of messages up or down to make room for steps I forgot.  Doing so shouldn't mess up my alignment, my lifelines, or any other portion of the diagram.</li>&#13;
<li>Infinite Undo<br />&#13;
Seriously.  We all make mistakes.  <strong>Every</strong> operation should be subject to Control-Z.</li>&#13;
<li>Supports Synchronous, Asynchronous, and Reflexive Messages<br />&#13;
Again, seriously.  Why are there tools that don't support reflexive (call myself) messages?</li>&#13;
<li>Dynamic Document Size<br />&#13;
I'm creating software design here, not a pretty drawing.  I don't care how big it gets; it's as big as it needs to be.  Don't restrict me to some printing size or other.  And on a related note...</li>&#13;
<li>Scrolling<br />&#13;
When these diagrams get complicated, I may need to draw a line all the way from one end to the other.  <em>Don't</em> make me zoom out so far I can't tell what I'm doing.  Just keep scrolling when I drag a line off the visible area.  And keep a marker or tooltip so I can tell which line I'm connecting to.</li>&#13;
<li>Shared Data Model<br />&#13;
When I change a class on the class diagram, the method should become available on the sequence diagram.  If I add a new method on the sequence diagram, it should show up on the class diagram.  All these drawings are descriptions of a single system; they should all be connected.</li>&#13;
<li>Supports Large Projects<br />&#13;
I'm dealing with thousands of classes, sometimes.  My tools should be able to deal with them, too.  Without crashing or even slowing down.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p>&#13;
These things would be nice to have, but they are not required:&#13;
</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li>Import Existing Code<br />&#13;
I can make everything myself, but importing the aforementioned thousands of classes would be nice.  I don't necessarily need a class diagram, but the tool should know who's derived from who.  Bonus points for automatically drawing the relationship when I put related classes on the diagram.</li>&#13;
<li>Code Generation<br />&#13;
I can write my own code.  Really.  I do it all the time.  As long as we've got all this UML, though, why don't you kick things off for me and save me some typing?</li>&#13;
<li>Design Patterns<br />&#13;
This would be useful for experts and learners alike.  Save me a little time and effort, give me a button that produces a Factory pattern from a few simple inputs.</li>&#13;
<li>Alignment and Spacing<br />&#13;
Okay, I'm not <strong>just</strong> making pretty pictures.  I want to be able to align the classes with their tops together, or align two asynchronous message interactions.  I want all those classes that implement one interface to look like I've drawn a single dotted line with lots of branches.  I want my classes spread out evenly.  Is this too much to ask?</li>&#13;
<li>Standard Format Import and Export<br />&#13;
I may switch tools someday.  I don't want to be locked into a single format.  Give me a way to save for other editors, and a way to import old projects.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p>&#13;
Anybody else want to add something?  Leave it in the comments, and I'll consider it.  Got a tool that does all that, and brings me a warm lunch?  I'd love to review it.  Just leave a comment, and I'll get to it as soon as time allows.  $DEITY knows I've got enough to model.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<h3>The Results So Far</h3>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li>
<a href="/progress/archives/331-UML-Editors-BOUML.html">BOUML</a> - <b>Unsatisfactory</b>, but it's still the best thing I can find.  Unfortunately, the project lead has taken down all downloads due to a copyright battle Wikipedia.  I am now actively looking for another editor... again.</li>&#13;
<li>
<a href="/progress/archives/333-UML-Editors-Umbrello.html">Umbrello</a> - <b>Unsatisfactory</b>, mostly because of its failure when rearranging sequence diagram actions, but also because it has trouble importing classes.  At least it's got a data model, though.</li>&#13;
<li>
<a href="/progress/archives/358-Rating-UML-Editors-Open-ModelSphere.html">Open ModelSphere</a> - <b>Poor</b>, because it's so limited and can't import my codebase.</li>&#13;
<li>
<a href="/progress/archives/339-Rating-UML-Editors-Dia.html">Dia</a> - <b>Poor</b>, because it's just a drawing program, not a modeling program.  But at least it draws diagrams pretty well.</li>&#13;
<li>
<a href="/progress/archives/332-UML-Editors-Gaphor.html">Gaphor</a> - <b>Fail</b>, because its lack of a model leaves it just a drawing program, and even then its missing some of the tools you need.</li>&#13;
<li>
<a href="/progress/archives/337-Rating-UML-Editors-ArgoUML.html">ArgoUML</a> - <b>Fail</b>, because it's a pain to work with and it has <b>NO UNDO</b>.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<h3>Some Other UML Modeling Programs</h3>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>
<a href="http://www.umlgraph.org/">UMLGraph</a> - Although it's kept up-to-date, it can't do sequence diagrams.</li>&#13;
<li>
<a href="http://www.papyrusuml.org/scripts/home/publigen/content/templates/show.asp?P=130&amp;L=EN&amp;ITEMID=4">Papyrus for UML</a> - An Eclipse plugin that looks intriguing, but apparently hasn't been updated since 2008.</li>&#13;
<li>
<a href="http://alexdp.free.fr/violetumleditor/page.php">Violet</a> - Even though it's from 2007, I installed it because it offered Eclipse integration, with drag-and-drop class import.  Unfortunately, it didn't automatically detect inheritance, it couldn't customize the class appearance, and it crashed Eclipse while trying to update a line.  Sigh.</li>&#13;
<li>
<a href="http://softeng.polito.it/projects/XUG/">XUG</a> - Looks like it's specifically designed for reverse engineering, may not support editing.  Since it's based on UMLGraph, it probably can't do sequence diagrams.  Oh, and it's from 2005.</li>&#13;
<li>
<a href="http://www.umlet.com/">UMLet</a> - An <b>even older</b> UML modeling program with no class import.</li>&#13;
<li>
<a href="http://lightuml.sourceforge.net/">LightUML</a> - a 2006 Eclipse plug-in.</li>&#13;
