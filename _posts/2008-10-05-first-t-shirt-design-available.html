</figure><p>I just made my first design, "Electric Love", available at <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/Judebert">CafePress</a>!  (I originally tried ShirtCity, but they couldn't make a decal in two colors, and their servers were too slow.)&#13;

It's designed for electric vehicle drivers, although it's pretty generally appealing, I think.  It's available as a decal for your car and a matching T-shirt for... well, surely you know how to wear a T-shirt.  &#13;
