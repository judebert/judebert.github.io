<p>&#13;
I started my studying today by looking at <i>Programming Interviews Exposed</i>.  The author indicates that linked-list problems are common in coding interviews, because they can be solved relatively quickly, but they still expose the coder's thought processes.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
As a Java programmer, I don't have much use for linked lists.  Java includes a LinkedList class that takes care of all the operations for me.  But according to the book, I might still be asked to implement a linked list of my own and solve some linked list problems... because it will expose my thought process.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Okay, I remember linked lists from back when I was a hot-shot C programmer.  (I used to think Java was a flash in a pan.  With the recent security vulnerabilities, it may turn out that way after all.)  I can do this.  But perhaps I should pass on the brain teaser for today.  The list problems can be my brain teaser.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Implement a singly-linked list.  Given a doubly-linked list (with tail pointer) where each node may have a doubly-linked list (without head or tail pointers) as a child, and the children may have their own children, flatten it to a plain doubly-linked list.  Now <i>put it back</i>.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
Implement a singly-linked list.  No problem; that's just a single element that points to the next element.  I can even genericize it.  Of course, you'll probably want insert and delete operations... and some way to traverse the list... hmmm, there's more work here than just the simple data structure, isn't there?  I'll implement just those operations.  If you really want me to implement the List interface I can, but it'll take a little longer.&#13;

Wow, it's a good thing I've got Eclipse at my back.  Typing that out without code completions and warnings took a lot longer than I expected.  And I made a few mistakes.  In particular, I have to remember that declaring an inner class with the same generic type parameter doesn't make a generic instance of that type; it <b>hides</b> the outer class's generic type declaration.  That's why I can get away without declaring MyNode&lt;T&gt;: it's redundant, and downright harmful.&#13;
</p>
<p>&#13;
That's quite a bit of code for one post.  I think I'll pick up with the flattening tomorrow!&#13;
