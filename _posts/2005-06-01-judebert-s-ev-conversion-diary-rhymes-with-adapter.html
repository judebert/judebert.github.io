<p>About this time, Nathan got really impatient about waiting for the adapter.  But at least he's got a sense of humor.</p><a id="extended"></a><blockquote>Is it in the mail, on the ground?<br />
On the back of a snail, going round and round?<br />
Is it in the air, on a whirlybird?<br />
Is it in your hair? Have you any word?<br />
Is it undersea, in a submarine?<br />
Perhaps on a golf tee? In a magazine?<br />
Is it underfoot, overhead?<br />
Perhaps we should look.  It might be dead.<br />
Is it in Red China? Defying a tank?<br />
Behind the reclina? I've looked there, I thangk.<br />
Is it in the car? Absolutely not.<br />
Under the bar? Behind the gutrot?<br />
Did it go to London? or go to France?<br />
Perhaps its in my underpants.<br />
Did it go to mars? To rove around?<br />
Is it canned in jars? Hidden underground?<br />
Did it go to Saturn, to see the rings?<br />
Perhaps with a lantern we could find the damn thing.<br />
On a 5-year mission? Or a 3-hour tour?<br />
Mated to a transmission? Not mine, that's for sure.<br />
Did it go to the Dark Side? Or Tatooine?<br />
Sucked away by a riptide? Trapped in quarantine?<br />
Did it elope to Vegas? Shooting craps on the strip?<br />
Run away with the Circus?  Fall in the cheese dip?<br />
Did it don a disquise? Dress like a clown?<br />
Did it meet its demise? Is it anywhere to be found?<br />
Is it in Witness Protection? Dancing with wolves?<br />
Does it fear rejection? Is it running with bulls?<br />
Is it looking for love in all the wrong places?<br />
Does it laugh from above at the egg on our faces?<br />
Perhaps by shouting its name real loud<br />
It'll answer our call and start coming round.<br />

Turns out their machinist threw out his back, holding up the queue for quite some time.  I responded in rhyme, but mine wasn't nearly so interesting.
