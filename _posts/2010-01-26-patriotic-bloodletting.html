    to take a daughter to school. I was hoping for some improvement, but I could still
    only do 13 push-ups. I figured that to improve, I needed to do more, so once I
    finished "

I gave blood today.  Apparently I have no center veins, so they had to use my right arm outer vein.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Which rolled out of the way.  Stung like the dickens, too.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
My nurse called over another nurse, who successfully stuck the vein without even pulling the needle out.  Then I stopped bleeding.  The same thing happened to me a few donations ago, but it was the other arm.  And it took that nurse 8 or 10 tries, with significant bruising, before she managed to stick the vein.  No idea what the problem was: clotting, piece of skin, whatever... that side was done.  They wrapped me up in a white bandage.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I had them try the other side.  Only an outer vein there, too.  This time we got it on the first try and managed to miss all my nerves: it barely hurt at all.  I was done bleeding in under 5 minutes.  They wrapped me up with a blue bandage.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
With my red shirt, white right arm bandage, and blue left arm bandage, I'm feeling very patriotic today.  :-D&#13;
