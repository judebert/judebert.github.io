Overall, my 4th of July holiday was pretty good.  I got a lot of programming done.  I got to show the older kids <i>Terminator</i> (which stood the test of time pretty well, except for one little section of special effects in <b>exactly</b> the wrong place).  I took a break from my workouts.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
My sister's Independence Day party was pretty cool, too.  I got to hook up with Phillip, a neat guy who I seldom get to see.  The kids all had a lot of fun.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But while we were out, somebody sneaked into my house and took my Wii.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I expect a kid, because he didn't take any of the other valuables in the house.  Instead, he left behind all the Wii games, accessories, and remotes -- and took a lunchbox.  I suspect a local kid, because the lunch box was found on the roof of a house only two doors down.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
My daughters are a little shaken to realize that somebody got into our house.  I'm just wondering what this kid's parents are thinking when Little Johnny suddenly acquires a Wii with a single disc, no game instructions or case, no remotes, and no power cords.  Don't they realize what's going on?&#13;
