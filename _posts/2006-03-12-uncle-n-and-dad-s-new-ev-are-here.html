<font size="4">MY UNCLE'S HERE! :-D</font> Dad's new EV, Silent E, came with him. We are so excited. As soon as he got here, M, K, and I(T) ran over to him even though we were barefoot. It was the first time we saw him in months. Our whole family had a job in order to succesfully back into our newly cleaned garage. Mom steered, Dad and N pushed, Melissa made sure the garage door could close, I(T) made sure the car didn't hit anything and K had the easiest job: sit in the car.  N had converted a Honda into an electric vehicle. We love playing Pawns, otherwise known as chess. I'm giving up my turn writing thi... Hey, I gotta go play chess! :-0&#13;
