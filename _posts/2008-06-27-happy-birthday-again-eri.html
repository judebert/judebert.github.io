My wife turns... um... another year older today!  We would've liked to have a day of celebration, but there's work, and kids, and friends in dire need of assistance.  But that won't stop me from wishing her a happy birthday immediately!&#13;

I'm taking a half-day, and we hope to watch WALL-E this afternoon.  For dinner, we've planned a garlic party with a friend of ours.&#13;

Happy birthday, Eri!  I love you!&#13;
