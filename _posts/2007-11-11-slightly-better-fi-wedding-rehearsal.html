<p>We had a second rehearsal this weekend.  Rather than big, ugly videos hogging my webspace and bandwidth, I decided to provide some ugly MP3s instead.  These were actually recorded from a real video camera, so the microphone quality should be better.  I own the copyrights to these audio files.&#13;
