We applied for the Amazing Race about this time.  I got in an auto accident trying to deliver the application video on time.  But that wasn't the end of the bad news...&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
My current car (the Prizm hatchback) needed new front tires, to the tune of $100.  They found a broken CV joint, for $200.  They also discovered that the rack was leaking, and needed to be replaced.  That would have been $1000.  One of the tie rod ends was worn, but I couldn't afford to replace that, either.  <b>I needed a replacement car.</b>&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The motor adapter, which we had ordered at the beginning of December 2004, still had not arrived.   They had originally estimated 4 weeks.  It had now been 2 months.  On March 4, 2004, I sent an email asking what had happened and found that a bout of the flu had halted production; they expected to have my adapter ready in a week.  Nathan thought he could finish up the car pretty quickly after that, so we'd have it be Thanksgiving, or maybe Christmas.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Meanwhile...&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
At work, they moved me to the project I had been competing against.  Everyone expected me to be all happy.   :-O &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
My kids got sick, and spiked fevers of 103 degrees.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
My wife's web store was floundering.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
At least I found <a href="http://p196.ezboard.com/fhondacivicwagonfrm8.showMessage?topicID=36.topic" title="Friendly Forum Post">information on Honda Civic Wagon suspension components</a> in <a href="http://hondacivicwagon.com">the friendly Honda Civic Wagon.com forum</a>.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Nathan and I spent the week figuring out what to do with the suspension.  Then we spent another week.  Just when I was starting to get concerned -- March 24, 2004 -- ElectroAutomotive explained that my adapter had "reached the top of the work queue" and was "in progress".  But they had experienced problems with Hondas before, so they wanted a paper tracing of my transmission housing.&#13;

<p>&#13;
Nathan was upset.  Why couldn't they have asked earlier, when we were waiting?  He sent the paper tracing anyway.  And it was a good thing, too; their patterns didn't match my transmission.  They needed the tranny and flywheel to design a new adapter plate.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Nathan was incredulous.  Couldn't they use the ID numbers we'd sent?  No, it turned out, they couldn't.  Nor was anyone on the EV list close enough to pull a junk tranny for me and hand it to them.  We drained the fluid we had <i>just put in</i> and shipped the tranny UPS for $105.  At least they offerred to pay the return shipping.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It arrived at ElectroAutomotive on April 15.  The kids were feeling better.  Maybe things would improve from here.</p>
