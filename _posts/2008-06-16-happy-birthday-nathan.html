<p>&#13;
I did tell you that I have to handle a lot of stuff in June, right?  Especially birthdays?&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Nathan's birthday is the latest.  This weekend we had our monthly family get-together, where we celebrated Nathan's birthday, Tatiana's birthday, and Father's Day.  For Nathan's birthday, we all went in together and purchased the parts to upgrade his computer.  Luckily, NewEgg had a cheap motherboard + CPU combo just in time.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'm doing the work now.  I'm copying his drives onto a backup, just in case.  The new motherboard only handles two of those obsolete PATA drives, so I'll have to crush both of his current ones onto a single drive.  Luckily, he's got lots of free space.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
When it's all done, he'll have a 3.0GHz Athlon64 with 1.5GB of memory (partly shared with an onboard nVidia chipset).  He wanted to play Uru; this should do that with plenty of guts to spare for whatever he wants to play for the next two years!&#13;

Happy Birthday, Nathan!&#13;
