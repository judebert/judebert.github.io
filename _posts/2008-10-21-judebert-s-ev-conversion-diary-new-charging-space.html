Yesterday I taught this year's first Math Super Stars class at my daughter's elementary school.  The principal agreed to allow me to charge the car while I was in.&#13;

A custodian and I found a nice plug just outside the cafeteria loading dock.  It has a locking cover, but it was unlocked!  Half a kilowatt-hour later, Silent E is happier.&#13;

Thanks, principal Cummings!&#13;
