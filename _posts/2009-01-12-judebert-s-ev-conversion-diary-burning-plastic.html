Lately I've been smelling something burning.  At first I thought it was the dust on my heater core, since I've been using it a little bit lately.  But no, the smell persists even with the heater off.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Then I realized that the smell started when I opened the rear battery box.  Sure enough, some of my homemade coroplast terminal protectors are melting.&#13;
</p> <a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
Melting.  Not only is the smell just terrible, I'm afraid it may have some health effects.  I've been checking for a couple of days, and it seems that two or three of my wires are causing the entire problem.  They get hot -- obviously not just warm -- even with my sedate driving.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
It's possible that a battery or two has gone bad, but I'm betting it's just that these wires have a greater resistance than they should.  (I mean, c'mon!  It's 2/0 gauge wire, it shouldn't be getting hot!)  I intend to check them with my multimeter at my first opportunity.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Of course, I've been really busy lately.  It seems that the hour and a half I spend working out in the mornings is having a much greater impact on my time than I expected.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
This is not the first time that strange smells have troubled Silent E, either.  Earlier this week we left E-chan at home charging.  When we came back, we smelled rotten eggs.  This is a sign of gassing batteries; obviously, the sulfur in the sulfuric acid can easily create the rotten-egg smell.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We opened all the battery boxes and smelled closely, but none of the batteries had the odor.  I think maybe the city uses sulfur water for irrigation.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
All told, perhaps I ought to be paying a little more attention to my batteries.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
<strong>Update 2009-01-13:</strong> I measured the battery voltages after discharge, and they're all within 0.1V.  I tried to check the resistance of the cable, but it came up <em>negative</em>.  I assume I'll have to check the resistance with the cable disconnected from the battery, which will take at least until the weekend.&#13;
