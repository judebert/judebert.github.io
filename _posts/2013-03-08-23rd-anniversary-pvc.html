Gotta love mitre saws.  Chopped the crappy fixtures off that old cannon in no time at all.  Then I bought <em>actual</em> Schedule-40 fittings from the sprinkler shop down the straight.  Cost an extra $5, but it's worth it for the safety.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Then, since it was our anniversary, Eri helped me put it all together.  We used the high-pressure "blue glue" and made certain to twist at least 90 degrees as we inserted everything.  We also redesigned it to use fewer fittings, which made the twisting phase a lot easier.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Working together, and being extremely careful, it took us about two hours all told.  We left it in the sun, and after about 5 hours of curing, I'll try it at tonight's performance of Hairspray!&#13;
