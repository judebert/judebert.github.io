<p>
Having <a href="/progress/EV/Keep-Em-Separated.html">fixed my stalling problem</a>, I'm examining my options for accessories.  I still need to hook up my tachometer somehow, although I've got the tach sensor installed.  I'd like to turn my facing gauges (fuel and heat) to an intersecting volt and amp display; and I want a speed switch.
</p><p>
The speed switch will <a href="/progress/EV/Disaster.html">help prevent disasters</a> like the one I had as a n00b.  The one I'm looking at is the <a href="http://www.isspro.com/proddetail.php?prod=R4902">ISSPRO r4902</a>.  It's got <a href="http://www.isspro.com/installation/IS006.pdf">dual adjustable NC/NO switches</a> and runs on 12V or 24V.  It's $224, but that's a bargain compared to a destroyed motor.
</p><p>
However, since we're transferring Kayla to a Montessori school, I might not be able to afford it for a while.  Until then, nobody else can drive my car.  (I'm heartbroken.)
