My, it's been cold here in Florida.  Cold for Florida, anyway.  This week of sustained freezing temperatures makes me feel like I'm back in North Carolina.  <a href="/progress/archives/373-Judeberts-EV-Conversion-Diary-Bad-Start-to-2010.html">The cold is bad for my range, too.</a>
</p><p>
Y'know what's great about an electric car, though?  <b>It's got an electric heater.</b>  That means I don't have to wait for the engine to warm up; I just flip the little switch and get a waft of hot air.  Unfortunately, that reduces my range, too.  
</p><p>  
This morning, after using the gas car to drop off my eldest daughter at her bus stop, I did something clever.  I plugged the EV in, turned on the heater, and cranked up the charger so I was replacing all the electricity the heater used up.
</p><p>
By the time I was ready to leave, the frost had melted off the windows and part of the roof.  The whole car was toasty warm.  
</p><p>
I think I have to start a list of The 10 Best Things About Owning an Electric Car, and this goes on the top.  I'm definitely doing it tomorrow!
