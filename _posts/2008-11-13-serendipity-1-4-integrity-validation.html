<a href="http://s9y.org">Serendipity 1.4 just went beta!</a>  That means my new upload validation code comes into play.
</p><p>
I developed the code a while ago, when people on the forums were having trouble with corrupted uploads.  Some clients were uploading everything in ASCII mode, some were skipping files... it was a nightmare.
</p><p>
The new validation is working, but as more people start testing it, we expect to find the edge cases.  <a href="http://board.s9y.org/viewtopic.php?t=14140">Like the installation problem reported on the forum.</a>  
</p><p>
Turned out the FTP server was stripping all the linefeeds out of a weird file.  I made <a href="/progress/media/s9y/sumcheck.zip">a PHP application to check your FTP client and server for hiccups</a> like the one that hit rj.  You should be able to just unzip it and upload the files to your server; when you visit sumcheck.php, it'll explain what you should be seeing.  You can let me know on the forums (or in the comments) if you find anything interesting.
