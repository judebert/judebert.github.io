I don't have the background in history to make this.  I found it somewhere.  I haven't got the faintest idea where; if you can tell me, I'll link to the original.&#13;
</p>&#13;
This is similar to the <a href="http://monster-island.org/tinashumor/humor/beeros.html">Beer OS humor</a>.  You can find lots of that from Google.&#13;
<p>&#13;
If your OS was a politician, which one would it be?  &#13;
</p>&#13;
<a id="extended"></a><h3>OS Politicians</h3>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>
<b>MS-DOS 1.0</b>: Herbert Hoover.  Aloof to the problems of the common man but friend of the engineer in all of us. Also discovered Transformers.</li>&#13;
<li>
<b>Mac OS 7, 8, and 9</b>: Franklin Roosevelt.  Very competent, led us through difficult times, but left a legacy of programs which have become quite a mixed bag.</li>&#13;
<li>
<b>Windows 3.1</b>: Dwight Eisenhower.   Amiable enough, competent, but leaving historians (and many contemporaries) very wanting.</li>&#13;
<li>
<b>Windows 95 thru ME</b>: Lyndon Johnson.  One of the boys, very able at getting things done, but in the end a disaster, rightfully ceding his throne.</li>&#13;
<li>
<b>Windows NT</b>: Richard Nixon.  The archetypal back-room politician, ruthless, and ultimately brought down by little faults, but many believe he was a great president and did much to modernize the Republican Party.</li>&#13;
<li>
<b>Windows XP</b>: Ronald Reagan.  Everybody who hates him never met him; he could charm anyone, the Great Communicator.  Bought Iranian weapons for contras with drug money.</li>&#13;
<li>
<b>Mac OS X</b>: Bill Clinton.  Cheerful and smart, if not the most productive. Known for his speeches.</li>&#13;
<li>
<b>Vista</b>: George W. Bush.  Elected because of his name, even though the prior iteration wasn't especially respected or well-liked. Introduced instability and performance issues, all in the name of "security". Many of the corporate interests who promoted him early on are having second thoughts.</li>&#13;
<li>
<b>Linux</b>: Fidel Castro.  The communist leader that has been in office for ages, just refuses to resign or die and points nukes at Windows from time to time.</li>&#13;
</ul>
