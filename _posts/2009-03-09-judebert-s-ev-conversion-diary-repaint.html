  content: Sounds like a plan. I'm not buying a new car anytime soon so I should probably
    do the same.

Electric motors and their supporting electronics are much more durable than the corresponding <acronym title="Internal Combustion Engine">ICE</acronym> equipment.  That means I'll own this car for a long time.  Therefore, I'd like it to look good and feel comfortable.&#13;

Nathan offered to pay for a paint job for my birthday.  I got some references and asked for estimates; they were uniformly in the $3000 to $5000 range.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Yesterday I got a $1400 estimate.  I'd have to leave the car for a week.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'd also lose my nice caution striping.  :(  But I've got an idea in that area: since the $1400 doesn't include any of the soft rubber molding, I'll just take it off and stripe it myself.  Then I'll have refreshed bumpers and molding, with a high-voltage look from all directions!&#13;
