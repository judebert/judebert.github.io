Eri bought me a Mac Mini for my birthday!  It should be here Thursday.  She said it was "almost free", since I'll be writing iPhone apps and selling them.  
</p><p>
Boy, I hope so!  I predicted a month to port Contraction Timer; I'm going to have to learn the XCode IDE, Objective C, and the iPhone environment to get started.  Then I can port.  Suddenly a month seems awfully short.

I'm just going to have to give up TV for a little while.  And books.
</p><p>
And maybe sleeping.
