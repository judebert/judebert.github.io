<p>So, my daughter goes to gym class.  She goes to class with no problems, but before Eri leaves, she notices that she's unhappy.  When she asks what's wrong, Kayla says, "My eyes keep getting wet."

Turns out she thought she was in the wrong class.  She perked right back up when she found out her class had been changed.
