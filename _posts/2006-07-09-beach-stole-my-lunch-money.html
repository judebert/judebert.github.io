<p>Yesterday we held Tatiana's birthday party at Canaveral National Seashore.  The waves were much bigger than you ever see at Daytona Beach.  Between them and the other beach activities, all I can say is that Canaveral National Seashore beat me up and took my lunch money.</p><a id="extended"></a><p>The waves were bigger than me.  Kayla, my 3-year-old daughter, would sit on the shore and occasionally get washed away by an ambitious wave, calling "Help! Help!".  That was nerve-racking.  But with her properly watched or distracted with a more dry activity, I decided to do some body surfing.
</p><p>
The first two waves I caught were sweet.  The next eight were useless.  When a giant (8 feet!) came by, I was frustrated enough to believe that it couldn't fail to sweep me away.
</p><p>
I was right.  Beyond right.  Everything was fine until the wave noticed me; then it slammed me into the sand, yanking my shoulder and giving me a rug burn.  It was then that I realized I was on the Gulf's turf.  I wonder how those surfers in Hawaii and California do it.
</p><p>
I got back up and tried again, but eventually decided to try something more tame: kite flying.  I don't exactly collect them, but I find kites enchanting.  I especially like the Smithsonian "Kite In A Can" that I picked up during my honeymoon.  It's a parafoil, and it had no problem with the fierce beach wind, providing what I'd guess to be 20 pounds of pull.
</p><p>
Fine for me; unfortunately, I let the kids have a shot at it, and they let the spool go.  While chasing it, I fell down, skinning my knee and nearly breaking my toe.  Luckily, a tree on the dunes caught the spool.  Unluckily, it's a $5000 fine to walk on the dunes.  A man with a fishing pole and a park ranger came to my aid; in the end, I climbed the tree to retrieve the spool.  The brush had long, sharp thorns.  That's how I got this, this, this, and that.
</p><p>
I did manage to save the kite.  Everyone enjoyed the party.  But boy, am I beat.
