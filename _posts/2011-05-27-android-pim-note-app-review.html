    I can search among the notes.  Besides, Samsung screwed up with my Galaxy S; why
    should I give them another chance with this thing?

<p>Ever since my first Franklin Planner, I've been a big believer in PIM (Personal Information Management).  Boy, was I ever glad to get rid of the paper and go digital with my Palm Pilot.  I went through a succession of Palm products, including the Sony Clie and a Treo.  When I heard that Palm was giving up on smartphones after the Pre, I was devastated; I had no idea what I would do when my Treo finally broke down.
</p><p>
The decision was forced upon me, shortly after I took my Treo for a swim.  (Note to self: ziploc bags aren't waterproof, even three layers deep.)  I'd seen Apple's idea of PIM from my wife's iPhone: barely functional, unless you paid for their Mobile Me service, in which case it was tolerable.  I decided to go with Android and got a Samsung Galaxy S.
</p><p>
Good lord the AT&amp;T Samsung Captivate <b><i>sucks</i></b>.  But the hardware itself is a post for another time; right now, I'm considering the Android PIM software independently.  I rate it about equal to the iPhone: barely functional.  The one big advantage is automatic sync with Google Calendar.
</p><p>
Notes are a big piece of PIM, though. Over the next few weeks, I intend to run several note-taking apps through my personal PIM wringer.  The winner will get the coveted "place on my phone" award.  And I'll have a record of what made the losers... well, losers.
</p><p>
Let's get to the rules!
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>
What do you want in a note-taking app?  Chances are it's a little different from what I want, which is listed below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><u>Text Entry</u></b>: The basic functionality.  A notepad app needs to take notes.  It should perform well with both short and long text.</li>
<li>
<b><u>Data Synchronization</u></b>: The big problem.  Android doesn't have a computer backup program, like Palm and Blackberry.  The data has to be stored somewhere OFF the phone, where I can restore it when necessary.  Google Docs would be fine with me.</li>
<li>
<b><u>Search Integration</u></b>: The second big problem.  I've got years of notes on my phone.  They're no good to me unless I can search through them.  And I don't mean from the program itself; I want notes to be searched from the main Android search button, duh.</li>
<li>
<b><u>Import/Export</u></b>: I've got <b><i>LOTS</i></b> of notes from my Palm days.  Wait... Palm <b>years</b>.  Whatever I use needs to import them, because I'm NOT entering them again.  Likewise, I realize someday I'll need to switch programs; exporting to CSV or some other format will help me when that day comes.</li>
<li>
<b><u>Data Hierarchy</u></b>: A big word for "tags".  It should be easy to categorize notes.  Palm used categories, a one-level hierarchy, like allowing a single tag on each note.  I like hierarchies (like directories) and multiple tags on a single note.</li>
<li>
<b><u>Data Integration</u></b>: When I enter a phone number, it should be recognized as a phone number; when I click on it, it should dial the phone directly from my note.  Same sort of thing for URLs and GPS coordinates.</li>
<li>
<b><u>App Integration</u></b>: I should be able to attach a note to an appointment in the calendar, or a task in the to-do list.  This is where I'm likely to be most dissapointed; I don't think there's any such integration <b>anywhere</b> on the Android platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think that's the basics of PIM.  I suppose I could go looking for extras like images in notes, or icons, but those aren't essential to the task of managing my data.  Everything else is subjective: ease of use, interface colors and icons, and so on.  
</p><p>
Since I've got so many Palm notes, I exported them to CSV so other programs could import them.  Unfortunately, that includes a lot of weird characters, and the title was saved in a separate field from the note.  I actually gave up Starcraft 2 in favor of <b>8 hours</b> taking care of all the abnormalities.  When I was done, though, I had several different formats of my Palm notes, including OpenOffice and Excel spreadsheets, and three different CSV files.  Earlier programming efforts gave me a directory full of individual notes that I'm not sure really reflect my memos... I'll have to spend <i>another</i> couple of hours tweaking that code to make sure it works as I want.
</p><p>
I've already searched the market for notepad apps, but if you think yours will beat my current champion on these grounds, let me know!  I'll be happy to give it a fair shake.  Links to the programs will appear below.  Let the best app win!
