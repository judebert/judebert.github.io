We've been fostering this cat, Mimi, for four weeks now.  With Tiffy gone, it seemed only natural to adopt Mimi.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
She's a neat cat.  She's never angry with the kids.  She likes to be petted -- sometimes.  And she and Pepper play together all the time.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Welcome to the family, Mimi!&#13;
