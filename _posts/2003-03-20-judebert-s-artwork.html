Yes, this is where I keep all my artwork, if you can call it that. (Go ahead, write me to confirm this opinion. Waste your time, see if I care.) Since I can't actually draw a straight line, I use computers that can. I'm was actually pretty active in 3D modeling and animation; held a job doing that for a few years. I haven't had any time for that recently, so instead I've done a little composition in my free moments.
