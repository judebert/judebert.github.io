<p>I did tell you I'm participating in a radio play, right?  It's called <i>The Page Turner</i>.  Episode 1, <i>Night of the the Fox</i>, was just released.  Read more to listen or download.</p><a id="extended"></a><p>I got involved with this because I thought it was an interesting concept.  I got lucky to land a part in my first audition!
</p>
<p>It moves a little fast, so if you have any questions, leave a comment and I'll be happy to answer.  At least, I'll pass any questions on to the producer.  And there'll be links to her websites, when they become available.</p>
