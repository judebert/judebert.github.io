On my way to work today, just outside UCF's parking garage C, SilentE reached 200,000 miles!  I took a crappy picture as I coasted slowly, with other cars getting frustrated at me.

Half a mile later I had the opportunity to take a decent picture at a stoplight.

Of course, only a small portion of those are <em>electric</em> miles.  But Honda Civic Wagons are kind of rare anyway, and 200,000 miles is a rare milestone in any car's life.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore!
