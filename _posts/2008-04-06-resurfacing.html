<p>Besides the work deadline, I'm also working on a Serendipity thumbnailing modification.  It's reasonably involved, since I have to ensure everything works in a way that will be backwards compatible.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I always hate returning to online life after a week.  The forums are backed up, the email is voluminous, the blog needs attention... it's just so much.  I wind up staying up late and getting sleep-deprived.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I'm going to start treating it like deep sea diving.  If I come up too quickly, I'll get the bends.  So, today: email, finish the s9y coding, and a quick explanatory blog post.  Tomorrow: read the s9y forums, distribute the s9y patch, and consider geeking something for a nice blog post with pictures.&#13;
