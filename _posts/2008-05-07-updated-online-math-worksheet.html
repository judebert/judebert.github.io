  content: "Great suggestion!  I'll add that to my to-do list.\r\n\r\nHave to be careful
    about spam, though: I wouldn't want to allow just anybody to send e-mails to anywhere
    they wanted."

I've improved my old multiplication worksheet!  The <a href="/progress/worksheet.php">new, improved, online timed math test</a> has all these features:&#13;
</p><ul>
<li>Online or printable worksheets!</li>&#13;
<li>Javascript test timer!</li>&#13;
<li>Customizable problem sets (Only want to work on the 7 and 8 facts?  Yeah, we can do that!)</li>&#13;
<li>All basic math operations, including:&#13;
<ul>
<li>Multiplication</li>&#13;
<li>Division</li>&#13;
<li>Addition</li>&#13;
<li>Subtraction with possible negative results</li>&#13;
<li>Subtraction with only positive results</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</li>
<li>Custom worksheet sizes</li>&#13;
<li>Next problem with Tab or Enter (supporting keyboard and 10-key pad)</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
The online functionality requires a browser with Javascript enabled.  &#13;
<p>&#13;
I'm also working on a Hall of Fame, but I'm worried about crackers.  Maybe I could make a Personal Best page, instead...&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
If you can think of any other features you want, just let me know!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
<i>Update 11:30 PM</i>: Now works properly in Internet Explorer!&#13;
</p>
