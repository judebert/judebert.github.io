  content: "Great suggestion!  I'll add that to my to-do list.\r\n\r\nHave to be careful
    about spam, though: I wouldn't want to allow just anybody to send e-mails to anywhere
    they wanted."

I've improved my old multiplication worksheet!  The <a href="/progress/worksheet.php">new, improved, online timed math test</a> has all these features:
</p><ul>
<li>Online or printable worksheets!</li>
<li>Javascript test timer!</li>
<li>Customizable problem sets (Only want to work on the 7 and 8 facts?  Yeah, we can do that!)</li>
<li>All basic math operations, including:
<ul>
<li>Multiplication</li>
<li>Division</li>
<li>Addition</li>
<li>Subtraction with possible negative results</li>
<li>Subtraction with only positive results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Custom worksheet sizes</li>
<li>Next problem with Tab or Enter (supporting keyboard and 10-key pad)</li>
</ul>
The online functionality requires a browser with Javascript enabled.  
<p>
I'm also working on a Hall of Fame, but I'm worried about crackers.  Maybe I could make a Personal Best page, instead...

If you can think of any other features you want, just let me know!

<i>Update 11:30 PM</i>: Now works properly in Internet Explorer!
