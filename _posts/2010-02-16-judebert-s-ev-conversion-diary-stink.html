A combination of cold, work, and family events has prevented me from working on my car lately.  After Kayla dinged my nice paint job with the door of our other car, I cleaned out my side of the garage and moved Silent E where she'd be safe.
</p><p>
After a quick 1.5A refresh charge, I figured I'd take another shot at rescuing my two leftover batteries.  They'd <a href="/progress/EV/Serial-Battericide.html">gone bad when I had my motor disaster</a>, as you recall.  Sometimes, if you use high voltage and low current, you can get the battery back.
</p><p>
The first battery seemed to work overnight!  It was at 13 volts the next morning.  I may be able to up my range a little, or replace that one battery that's driving me nuts!  I plugged the second battery in and left it overnight.
</p><p>
The next morning I kept waking up, wondering what the horrible smell was.  I thought a cat had been incontinent right in the room.  It was terrible.  Eri woke up once, too; she asked if I had been farting.   :-O  When she mentioned it smelled like rotten eggs, a light went off: sulfur!
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>
I rushed out to the garage to see if the battery had exploded.  The smell was definitely stronger here; apparently it was leaking into the air conditioner's fan box and being carried all through the house.  I opened the garage door a crack to let the stink out.
</p><p>
The battery looked fine, but one of the terminals was turning black.  I shut off the charger and disconnected the battery.  It was very warm.  I decided to shove it outside.
</p><p>
As soon as I touched it, it vented a cloud of gas.  I jumped back, but returned immediately to shove it the rest of the way out the door.  Another cloud of gas, this time OUTSIDE the garage.  I shut the garage door a bit to prevent any further gassing from getting in.
</p><p>
I opened the windows in the house to let the stink out.  When the kids woke up, the smell was still there.  I was afraid it would stick to everything and never leave.  
</p><p>
The only good thing about this is that I don't need to be paranoid about overcharging and venting my batteries any more.  I've listened for tiny clicking noises that might indicate a battery was being overcharged.  I've questioned every slight odor in the car.  
</p><p>
Having experienced the stink, I can definitively say that I've never vented a battery.  The regulators are doing their job!
