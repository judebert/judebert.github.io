<p>
My daughter is home sick, so today I used my lunch "hour" to eat with her.  I stopped at the <a href="http://www.redbrickpizza.com/">Red Brick Pizza</a> on my way home to get something that we'd both enjoy.
</p><p>
Naturally, I asked the guy if I could plug in.  He didn't even flinch, just asked, "Just a regular outlet?"  
</p><p>
The outlet was behind the shop, in the grass, and a UPS truck was already using the ramp.  I had to drive on the concrete pad that holds the air conditioning condensers.  That was actually kind of fun, but next time I'll go around the other way; more grass, less close quarters.
</p><p>
They even offered to bring the pizza out back next time!  (The only reason they didn't do it this time was because I was already gone when they stepped out to ask me.)  
</p><p>
Definitely a cool stop.  Great food and friendly people.
