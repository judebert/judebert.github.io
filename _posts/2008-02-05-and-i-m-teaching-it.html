<p>I teach Math Superstars at my kids' elementary school.  It's a supplemental math program (as if you couldn't guess).  This year I'm teaching both kids' classes: one Kindergarten and one 4th grade.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I wear a wizard's hat from an old Halloween costume, along with my old graduation robe (whaddaya know, it <b>is</b> good for something) and call myself a mathemagician.  I think 4th grade is about the limit for this kind of thing, but at least I'm recognizable.  In fact, they took my picture for the yearbook today.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
But sometimes you've got to wonder if I'm smart enough to do this.&#13;
</p><a id="extended"></a><p>&#13;
Don't get me wrong, I love math.  I'm pretty good at it: I minored in mathematics after Differential Equations blew me away.  But I understand all the algebra they're using, lots of the calculus they don't, and even some math history and weirdness that piques their interest.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
The melding of math and computers is ideal, too.  My wife and I (mostly her) made a beautiful <a href="http://openoffice.org">Open Office</a> spreadsheet that keeps track of all the scores, prints beautiful little star cards for each student, and tells me when they earn one of the prizes.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Unfortunately, sometimes there's a lot of work to do.  Like this week.  I had to stay up grading papers until midnight because I had two weeks of backlog.  Naturally, that means a lot of kids have passed prize points, so I have a lot of certificates to fill out.  And we had some trouble getting out of the house, so I'm rushing.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I print the star cards for last week, the summary sheets with points and prize list, and the star cards for this week.  I drop off the kids, sign in, stuff my hat on my head, and rush to the library.  I use their paper guillotine (the one with the giant chopping blade) to cut the star card sheets into their individual little cards.  Shoop!  Shoop!  Shwop! Swish! Swap!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Then I start looking for my summary sheets.  Of course, they were sandwiched between the star cards.  They're now in convenient 4cm x 6cm squares.  &#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I actually taped them back together so I could figure out what prizes I was supposed to get for whom.  I wound up using all the tape on the librarian's desk.  And I arrived in class only 3 minutes late.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
If an idiot cuts an important sheet of paper into nine equal squares, how much tape will he need...&#13;
