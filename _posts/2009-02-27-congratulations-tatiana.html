<p>&#13;
Once again, I had the privilege of attending an honors breakfast for my daughter Tatiana.  She hasn't missed one!  Only one more to go before she's had straight As all through middle school!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We'll have to do something special for her if she makes it.  New phone?  Dinner at The Melting Pot?  New Wii game?  I dunno; something!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Congratulations, Tatiana!  I'm proud of you!&#13;
