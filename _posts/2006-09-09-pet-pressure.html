<p>Well, it looks like I'm overruled.  The girls want a pet, and not a fish, either.  They want something they can cuddle.  I won't take a puppy or another cat.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
So of course they go straight for the rodents.  They want a guinea pig.  I thought I could put it off: I tried explaining that they're too mean to each other to cooperate over a pet.  But they started cooperating.  Now, if they just get their rooms clean, three days later I have to get them a guinea pig.&#13;

Don't go thinking I fell for it easily, though.  I know better than to make any concrete deadlines or conditions.  <b>I</b> certainly wasn't the one who got roped into this.  No, it was my <i>wife</i>!  Traitorous, that one.  Turns out she wants a guinea pig, too.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Next thing you know, she'll want another baby.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Why couldn't they have gotten a nice tarantula?  Or a snake?  Well, at least guinea pigs are diurnal.&#13;
